"So far, the major global policy to address aviation emissions has been an offsetting scheme developed by the UN aviation agency ICAO."
"However, the scheme has long been slammed as inadequate by campaigners, who criticise its failure to incentivise airlines to cut their own emissions by instead allowing them to buy cheap offsets, and only for only applying to emissions above 2019 and 2020 levels."
"Last year the body changed this joint baseline year to 2019 due to the collapse of international air traffic in 2020."

"ith all the hubbub about SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk being approved to buy Twitter, there remains a giant elephant in the room — and it means the deal may not go through at all."
"At first glance, everything looks kosher."
"There's also the small matter of China to contend with."
"As the column also explains, China is home to half of Tesla's production and a quarter of the company's revenue — and it's a serious Twitter foe, given the company's fights with Beijing over Hong Kong protests ."
"Should China decide to interfere, it could cause a quagmire for Musk that would be nearly impossible to untangle without him walking away from buying Twitter."
"It's also unlikely that Musk's purported free speech absolutism, which many critics say will result in fewer penalties on hate speech and disinformation on Twitter, would even hold water when if he takes the helm of the social media company."

"Massive chunks of the rocket screamed over and over several major US cities before splashing down in the Atlantic Monday afternoon, as confirmed by the US Air Force ."
"Now, it sounds as though parts falling off it may have left a trail of debris."
"According to The Verge , bits of the rocket appear to have touched ground on the Ivory Coast."
"Local media reported that mysterious metallic objects were raining from the sky."
"Both of these are conservative estimates, as the number of rocket launches is increasing quickly."
"Assuming again that each reentry spreads lethal debris over a 10m 2 area, we conclude that current practices have on order a 10% chance of one or more casualties over a decade."
"In the first method (perigee cut), there is no explicit reentry timescale."
"As such, only the year 2020 world population is used to calculate the corresponding casualty expectation."
"This method most clearly identifies the consequences of the long-lived on-orbit rocket body population."
"However, in doing so, the providers are denying themselves the opportunity for a controlled reentry."
"Such an approach to mission design will also have to be changed to achieve a safe, controlled reentry regime."
"Most of these measures cost money."
"In the case of the Delta IV rocket, the US government reportedly granted waivers because of the high costs of upgrades 5 , even though, as the entity procuring these launches, it was well positioned to absorb the increased cost of safer missions."

"Depending on when you were born, you still remember a time without laptops and mobile phones."
"It actually seems like computers evolve much faster than everything else."
"So fast that society has trouble keeping up with the technology."
"But is it possible to somehow measure this pace?"
"This is where Moore’s Law comes into play, as a way to predict development of computer chips. Computer chips are what economists call a “general purpose technology”."
"Technology that has such fundamental use cases that it can support a wide range of industries."
"Moore’s Law is an expectation, not a natural law. But since Intel co-founder Gordon Moore has first talked about it in 1965, it has proved to be very accurate."
"Let us try to derive a clear definition for Moore’s Law and get an idea of the technology behind it."
"The era of big data. A very popular buzz word. Standing for the way how everything is generating and running on tons of data nowadays."
"Have you ever wondered where data is actually stored and processed?"
"And how does it work that you can access all that data from your smartphone?"
"Blockchain is the reason that drives so much investment into the cryptocurrency market (besides greedy speculation)."
"While Bitcoin and blockchain are inevitably linked, actually Bitcoin is only one of many use cases blockchain offers."
"Because at its core, blockchain is not more than a decentralized database that can be used to store any type of data."
"Climate Change is one of the most important challenges of our times."
"It is not easy to formulate a clear definition for what biotechnology is."
"More specifically, a collection of techniques that are about analyzing and altering the basic building blocks of life."
"Molecular biology, as a subarea of biology, concerns structure and function of macromolecules. Central to molecular biology is research about DNA and RNA."
"So, one way to put it, biotechnology is the notion that molecular biology is not only about understanding nature but increasingly about altering it."
"Most agricultural goods we use today are a product of some form of biotechnology."
"Such a segment that determines one specific characteristic of the organism is called a gene."
"In a process called transcription, RNA is built from DNA."
"Once we understand a system well enough, the idea of tampering with it comes pretty naturally."
"The descriptions are kept very general and brief."
"Less than a decade ago, scientists discovered CRISPR gene editing – the CRISPR-Cas9-method."
"Arguably, CRISPR is the most advanced genome editing technique known today, basically promising arbitrary, fast and easy gene editing."
"A transistor is a component of an electrical circuit."
"The more transistors an electrical circuit has, the higher the logical complexity."
"Put an electrical circuit on a piece of semiconducting material and you have an integrated circuit (IC)."
"How does it come that Moore’s Law has been so accurate for 50 years?"
"The constant improvement of cost to performance ratios fuels an ever-growing demand, thus an ever-growing semiconductor market."
"As a consequence, more investment comes into the market to further improve the products."
"The main driver has been the idea to reduce the size of circuits by scaling down transistors."
"The smaller the transistor, the smaller the circuit, the higher the number of transistors per IC."
"Computing power is basically a fundamental requirement for everything!"
"Almost every technology of the 20th century is a direct reflection of Moore’s Law."
"When transistors reach the size of a handful of atoms, quantum effects become relevant."
"As a matter of fact, humanity has already practiced geoengineering for quite some time."
"Even though it is not their actual intention, coal-fired power stations, cars and droves influence biogeochemical cycles quite a bit."
"But what are these biogeochemical cycles?"
"The concept of biogeochemical cycles states that a number of chemical elements go through cycles."
"Still, the idea of man-made climate sounds nuts to a lot of people."
"Geoengineering is definitely a controversial topic."
"You have probably already seen someone wearing a sort of wired net on his head."
"Electroencephalography is a method to observe electrical activity of the brain."
"The fundamental parts of a neuron are the cell body (the soma), the dendrites and the axon."
"The axon usually connects the neuron to other nerve cells and allows the transportation of nerve impulses away from the cell body."
"The amplifier takes two inputs and outputs the differences between them, while rejecting the common signals."
"A person wearing an EEG could rip it off anytime."
"However, there are different approaches, some based on chemical signals, some based on optical signals and so on."

"The annoying thing is that silicon is not biocompatible."
"Imagine someone that is paralyzed from the neck down because his spinal cord is severed."
"The internet plays already an important role in our communication, for some it may be the most important way to communicate."
"It is common knowledge that a human has five senses. Sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch."
"If we take a closer look at how our five senses work, we discover that eventually all five senses convert whatever signals into electrochemical signals."
"The term “smart city” is a little hard to define, since there are so many different concepts of a smart city."
"They all try to improve their citizens quality of life, by integrating technologies from the information and communication technology sector (ICT)."
"Inevitably, another modern buzzword comes to mind —IoT, the Internet of things. Obviously, there is a very strong connection between these two concepts."
"One of the most important things is to establish good geographical information systems (GIS)."
"For regulating traffic, distributing resources and many other challenges a modern city faces, it is extremely helpful to have reliable real time data."
"Due to directives or competition in a sense, sharing information between city departments is not always easy"
"To achieve optimal exchange of information it needs a culture of open collaboration inside the city’s offices."
"Due to cultural and historical reasons, people around the world have different perceptions of privacy."
"There are two major problems with AI making decisions: The first one is that the algorithm does not have values which it considers when making a decision, like a human would do. Secondly, if the algorithm was trained with bad data, it can be biased or even discriminating against certain types of people."
"Mixed realities try to combine AR and VR so that objects from the virtual and the real world can interact with each other."
"Actually, the key hardware components for an augmented reality system are not too special."
"In mobile devices like smartphones and tablets the processor, the display and all sensors are right beside each other, so that they form one physical device."
"Smartphones already contain all the necessary elements."
"The difference is that a traditional weapon needs to be operated by a human, whereas an autonomous weapon operates itself."
"Nowadays lethal autonomous weapons systems are already quite advanced and have a lot of things automated, like target recognition and categorization (an object is categorized as good or bad)."
"In AI research this question is called the value alignment problem."

"Worry about inflation has topped Ipsos's What Worries the World survey for the third month in a row - and concern about inflation has risen for 11 straight months. 37% of people in 27 countries around the world cited inflation as one of the top issues facing their country today. This is a rise of 3 percentage points from May. The growing concern about inflation comes during a global cost of living crisis and surging inflation in many economies around the world."
"Three in four IT workers in India are coming into the office less than once a week according to a survey by HR firm CEIL, reported in The Economic Times. In the US, the app Yelp is closing its offices in New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The company said that average weekly workspace utilization was less than 2%, according to CBS News."
"The current recession, unlike past economic slumps that have tended to be worse for men, is disproportionately bad for women. It comes after a period where the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple shocks in the global economy have hindered progress on closing the gender gap. Women’s jobs were 1.8 times more vulnerable than those of men throughout the pandemic and are suffering more disruption in the subsequent economic fallout."
"Inequities in the labour force have been significantly exacerbated during the pandemic, which increased the burden of care work on women and shuttered many sectors that had high levels of female employment – like travel and tourism or retail. At the same time, some of the sectors under greatest duress are those that employ large numbers of women – healthcare, education and other essential work."
"More than 50 companies have joined the First Movers Coalition which aims to decarbonize the heavy industry and long-distance transport sectors responsible for 30% of global emissions."
"The companies have sent the largest market signal in history to commercialize emerging clean technologies by making unprecedented advance purchase commitments by 2030."
"Denmark, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and the United Kingdom have joined the US as government partners to create early markets for clean technologies through policy measures and private sector engagement."
"But digital technology is not only about reach. It is also a powerful tool for empowerment. Digital tools can provide greater control and access to information for large swathes of humanity – whether they are farmers in remote villages checking on crop prices or young people and their teachers accessing educational materials online across Asia, Africa and Latin America."
"In the early days of the internet, information was mostly siloed within proprietary online networks."
"However, the zero marginal cost of distribution, combined with consumer demand, led to the single, searchable, open internet of information we enjoy today."
"The advent of Web3 technology enables the automation of settlement by smart contracts and the tokenisation of physical asset commerce transactions into a universal standard such as NFTs."
"The amount of information - or data - about our universe and about ourselves, has grown exponentially over the past decade."
"We're missing what we removed from our interactions a decade ago: humanity, intimacy, depth, and empathy. Real conversations instead of mass influence. Interactions that make us feel closer to each other."
"The construction industry accounts for almost 40% of global CO2 emissions and much of this is driven by the urbanisation of humanity."
"Fossil fuels continue to power construction projects, resulting in around half a billion tonnes of CO2 emitted each year."
"Noise and exhaust fumes from fossil fuel use also negatively affect worker health and local air quality."
"90% of life is spent indoors and 50% of carbon emissions are created by buildings."
"One pressing challenge that lies on the road to a clean-energy future is grid flexibility, and the need for more dynamic interaction between energy supply and demand."
"Though nourishing, tasty food should be available to wealthy and poor alike, too often there is a great gulf between the “is” and the “should.”"
"Several decades of accelerating climate change, a global pandemic, conflict, and fragmented supply chains impacted food production and distribution, driving the global food crisis to catastrophic levels."
"The traditional education system was invented nearly 200 years ago to meet the needs of the industrial revolution – it is not functional today."
"Today, the needs of our world have been gathered under the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals."
"The younger generation already has the desire to co-create solutions to the world's biggest problems and create a more compassionate world."
"Office work has been the default for knowledge workers for decades and did not warrant a full re-think until the pandemic. The pandemic tested it to its fullest but although we saw flat to increased productivity, the loss in cultural connectivity and an increase in anxiety, fatigue, apathy and burnout are all also some of the effects being felt."
"The apparel industry is riddled with excessive waste and supply chain challenges."
"Today, most brands and retailers are forced to mass-produce goods with limited consumer input, resulting in high merchandise return rates, waste from overproduction, and lower profit margins due to deep discounts of unwanted merchandise."
"The most common infertility treatment today, in-vitro fertilization (IVF), is expensive, often requires multiple attempts, and is both physically and emotionally onerous."
"Successful pregnancies from IVF rely on a complex set of clinical decisions made by physicians to deliver the optimal care for each patient."
"In modern times, email may have replaced the need for a courier and documents may be stored electronically, but the underlying technology itself hasn’t changed."
"Computers aren’t very good at manipulating natural language (analogue), but they are great at manipulating information in a database (digital)."
"Rapid advances in smartphone optical sensors and positional systems provide extensive access for growers and conservationists to affordably capture rich datasets."
"Paper and pencil tracking, luck, significant global travel and opaque supply chains are part of today’s status quo, resulting in large amounts of wasted energy, materials and time."
"Right now, the development of pharmaceuticals and performance materials relies massively on trial and error, which means it is an iterative, time-consuming and terribly expensive process."
"Sheltering-in-place has moved businesses and classrooms to video conferencing, highlighting poor-quality networks."
"Technology drives data, data catalyzes knowledge, and knowledge enables empowerment."
"Historically, robotics has turned around many industries, while a few select sectors - such as grocery retail - have remained largely untouched."
"Microfulfillment centers are located in existing (and typically less productive) real estate at the store level and can operate 5-10% more cheaply than a brick and mortar store."
"One thing the current pandemic has shown us is how important technology is for maintaining and facilitating communication - not simply for work purposes, but for building real emotional connections."
"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic we saw a lot in the news about concerns over the security of video conferencing companies."
"Using data to deeply understand industry processes is profoundly enhancing the ability of field professionals to trust their instincts in real-time decision making, enabling learning and progress while gaining trust and adoption."
"Actionable data sheds light where we could not see before, empowering leaders to manage projects proactively rather than reactively."
"Precision in planning and execution enables construction professionals to control the environment, instead of it controlling them, and creates repeatable processes that are easier to control, automate, and teach."
"Medicine has always been on a quest to gather more knowledge and understanding of human biology for better clinical decision-making."
"Financial advisors, who are knowledge workers, have been the mainstay of wealth management: using customized strategies to grow a small nest egg into a larger one."
"Since knowledge workers are expensive, access to wealth management has often meant you already need to be wealthy to preserve and grow your wealth. As a result, historically, wealth management has been out of reach of those who needed it most."
"The built environment, where humans spend 90% of their lives, is laden with naturally occurring microbiomes comprised of bacterial, fungal and viral ecosystems."
"Traditionally, industries like manufacturing and oil and gas have been slow to implement decarbonization efforts as they struggle to maintain productivity and profitability while doing so."
"Despite the accelerating regulatory environments we’ve seen surface in recent years, we are now just seeing the tip of the privacy iceberg, both from a regulatory and consumer standpoint."
"While the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a difficult lesson in just how susceptible our world is today to human and economic turmoil, it has also - perhaps for the first time in history - necessitated global collaboration, data transparency and speed at the highest levels of government in order to minimize an immediate threat to human life."
"History will be our judge, but despite the heroic resolve and resiliency on a country by country basis, as a world we have underperformed."
"As a global community and through platforms like the World Economic Forum, we must continue to bring visibility to these issues while recognizing and supporting the opportunities for technology and innovation that can best and most rapidly address them."
"Over the past two years, the World Economic Forum – working in close collaboration with a diverse group of experts – has been working on advancing the field of ethics in technology."
"This group agreed on the important goal of providing tools and techniques that leaders can use to operationalize ethics during the lifecycle of technology."
"This multi-stakeholder project community has made the case for both human-rights-based and ethics-based approaches to the responsible use of technology, promoted the use of behavioural economics principles in organizational design to drive more ethical behaviour with technology, and highlighted techniques for responsible technology product innovation."
"However, as our society becomes more aware of the impact of technologies on human rights, leaders are looking at the earliest stages of technological innovation. They are beginning to ask whether investors are conducting ethics and human rights assessments of the start-ups they are investing in or incubating."
"A recent report published by Amnesty International reveals that none of the top-10 venture capital firms on the Venture Capital Journal’s top-50 list had adequate human rights due diligence policies in place when evaluating companies."
"The year 2021 will be remembered in history as a pivotal year for tech regulation globally. Indeed, earlier this year, the European Commission (EC) released its Artificial Intelligence Act, a comprehensive regulatory proposal that classifies all AI applications under four distinct categories of risks (unacceptable risk, high-risk, limited risk and minimal risk) and introduces specific requirements for each of them."
"Public sentiment is shifting in the US as well."
"In an April 2021 Pew Research Center survey, 56% of Americans professed support for more regulation of major technology companies versus 47% in June 2020."
"Until recently, most students who studied computer science, electrical engineering, and data science could graduate without taking an ethics course."
"This is unlike other disciplines such as law and medicine, which treat ethics as a key component of professional training."
"Most technologists in the workplace today were not even exposed to the social sciences or humanistic aspects of their future professions throughout their formal education."
"Some companies are already mandating responsible technology training for all employees."
"Laissez-faire approaches to governance that enable the use and misuse of technology platforms are no longer tolerated."
"Indeed, in our work on the Responsible Use of Technology project, we have seen growing interest and participation in sectors from banking to food and beverage -- reminding us that every company is now a technology company."
"In economic terms, the results of urbanization have been nothing but impressive."
"Cities are accountable for 80% of global GDP. For instance, the Boston-NYC-Washington corridor together with the LA region generates more than 30% of the United States’ annual output."
"Success always comes at a cost, and the success of cities is no exception."
"Unsustainable consumption patterns, environmental degradation, and persistent inequity are only a few of the issues that afflict modern cities."
"Anyone who has ever visited Shanghai, New York, or any other modern megacity lined with gravity-defying skyscrapers can attest to their unique capacity for scale."
"However, something much more astonishing is happening behind the scenes."
"According to recent research spearheaded by Geoffrey West and Luis Bettencourt, cities take human and physical capital and scale them superlinearly."
"In apparent defiance of traditional arithmetic, cities produce more units of output for each unit of input they use when it comes to game-changing statistics such as GDP, wages, patents, and R&D expenditures."
"Even better, cities waste fewer resources per capita on infrastructure and services."
"This makes them ideally suited for providing realistic answers to the biggest global challenges."
"Recent studies have shown that cities excel in fostering community attachment, which is found in open spaces ripe with social offerings, accessible educational systems, and opportunities for civic involvement."
"Luckily for us city dwellers, community attachment itself is a positive feedback mechanism that is correlated with overall happiness, GDP growth, and many other desired features of modern life."
"In fact, today there are already more functional cities than nation states."
"However, even with all their economic prowess and penchant for openness, cities still lack the final ingredients for sustainable dominance: political clout and sovereignty."
"From the United States’ National League of Cities to the international Global Parliament of Cities, mayors across the world are forging partnerships that derive their power from shared interests rather than geographical proximity or political collegiality."
"At the same time, provincial leaders ranging from Bavaria to Punjab are busily setting up independent trade and investment promotion offices in a competitive bid for financial flows and tourism."
"For example, while there are few meaningful parallels between the United Kingdom and Turkey, the ‘remain’ votes of London, Liverpool, and Manchester in the Brexit referendum were driven by similar forces as the ‘against’ votes of Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir in the constitutional referendum in Turkey."
"New York and San Francisco have committed to the Paris Agreement, alongside more than 380 other cities, even though the country itself has rejected it."
"And while we may not see Ithaca Hours challenging the greenback any time soon, it is already obvious that cities do not need anyone’s permission to make the best of their urban sovereignty."
"In smart cities like Tallinn, citizens engage with their urban government effortlessly via digital platforms that enable them to sign contracts, file their taxes, and vote in the Estonian national elections."
"Perhaps the most underappreciated promise of digitization is localized e-governance."
"In this new environment, business model change often translates to skill set disruption almost simultaneously and with only a minimal time lag (Figure 8A)."
"Our respondents report that a tangible impact of many of these disruptions on the adequacy of employees’ existing skill sets can already be felt in a wide range of jobs and industries today (Figure 8B)."
"During previous industrial revolutions, it has often taken decades to build the training systems and labour market institutions needed to develop major new skill sets on a large scale."
"Given the upcoming pace and scale of disruption brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, however, this may simply not be an option."
"For example, current technological trends are bringing about an unprecedented rate of change in the core curriculum content of many academic fields, with nearly 50% of subject knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year technical degree outdated by the time students graduate, according to one popular estimate."
"A focus on the state of the talent pipeline for traditional formal qualifications and ‘hard skills' therefore risks dramatically understating the scale of impending skill set disruption if a large part of the existing subject knowledge of the current workforce will be outdated in just a few years."
"Beyond hard skills and formal qualifications, employers are often equally concerned about the work-related practical skills or competences that current employees (or prospective new hires) are able to use in order to perform various job tasks successfully."
"There are various reasons for such dramatic shifts in expected skills requirements."
"While most jobs require use of a wide range of skills, somewhat different skill set combinations are sought after in different industry sectors."
"In light of technological trends such as the ones outlined in this Report, in recent years many countries have undertaken significant efforts to increase the amount of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates produced by their national education systems (Table 8A)."
"Yet when it comes to the traditional tools policymakers and employers have at their disposal to navigate this change there often is a time lag of months, if not years, until updated information becomes available."
"For example, hundreds of millions of workers across the globe have added their professional information—including their education, skills, and past and present jobs—to online talent platforms such as LinkedIn, affording these providers with unique insights into changing skills supply."
"Around 36% of respondents also voiced a concern about the availability of qualified talent, in particular employers in the Energy, Information and Communication Technology and Mobility industries."
"The Information and Communication Technology industry sees this issue as their main barrier to a more gender balanced workforce."
"Basic and Infrastructure has a similarly low number of female junior staff, but there is less emphasis by respondents on incoming talent qualification, with unconscious bias by managers instead cited as the top concern."
"Lack of work-life balance is perceived as a particular barrier in the Consumer and Financial Services & Investors industries."
"Many employers thus believe lack of work-life balance is a key deterrent to women’s participation at work. This factor thus appears to influence all industries."
"While in nearly all industries and geographies there has been a marked shift away from deliberate exclusion of women from the workplace, there continue to be cultural beliefs that lead to unconscious biases."
"This includes perceptions that successful, competent women are less nice; that strong performance by women is due to hard work rather than skills; and assumptions that women are less committed to their careers."
"In addition, especially in well-established, older organizations, workplace structures that were designed for a past era still, often unwittingly, favour men."
"Additionally, women’s historically low participation in the labour market means they have relatively fewer role models to look towards across all industries."
"Research from the US, UK and Germany suggests that women have a poor perception of senior roles and lack a clear line of sight as to how senior leadership positions might help them achieve their objectives, lacking role models who can reveal the trade-offs and benefits they bring."
"Women’s confidence and aspirations are seen as another barrier. Women are less likely to want a top job—citing the stress or pressure of the role as a deterrent."
"In order to map labour market changes, LinkedIn’s analytics describe each job function as an agglomeration of skills, enabling the platform to nowcast changes in the skills landscape as members update their professional information."
"This enables the platform to identify clusters of skills that are particularly associated with the profiles of members with common job functions and titles and to map how these change over time."
"It also allows for identifying nuances and differences between the skill sets of common job functions in different industries or geographies."
"For example, the heatmap below shows how the most common skills reported by mechanical engineers vary across different industries."
"The dark blue color in area 1 in the chart below shows that mechanical engineers working in various sectors of the Mobility industry have similar skills."
"It also shows that their skills differ from the skills of mechanical engineers who work in the Healthcare industry (area 2) or the Energy and Basic and Infrastructure sectors (areas 3 and 4)."
"This supply-side analysis can be complemented with analysis of skills demand—whether based on job listings, within-job hiring rates, governmental forecasts, or employer surveys such as the one presented in this Report—to identify emerging skills gaps and inform training and skills programmes to prepare the workforce for future requirements."
"At the national level, countries experience varying inflows and outflows of talent over time."
"Outflows and inflows of talent often do not have the same skills compositions, resulting in a correlation between talent mobility and changing skills gaps across countries and over time."
"At same time, however, job families expecting the highest employment growth, such as Architecture and Engineering and Computer and Mathematical, currently have some of the lowest female participation and find it much harder than average to recruit women."
"Our respondents’ views concerning the barriers to women’s workforce participation vary by industry and often reflect different industry cultures in addition to overarching economic and societal factors."
"Finally, where each industry stands specifically is often affected by how recently an industry has improved its gender balance."
"Given that career choices are disproportionately affected by prior experience and bias, traditionally male dominated professions often find it difficult to attract women."
"TODAY, HOMES ARE increasingly “smart,” with wired fridges, doorbells, and other WiFi-enabled devices booming."
"And yet, of all home security concerns, one of the most critical tech upgrades is happening in a space often overlooked: the very air we breathe."
"Smart Detection is an array of WiFi-enabled alarms that detect threats of smoke, carbon monoxide (CO), water leaks, frozen pipes, and indoor air quality issues, and it provides alerts—all monitored by homeowners in a single app."
"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), roughly 50,000 people per year go to the emergency room due to accidental carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning."
"Using a built-in air quality sensor, the WiFi-enabled device measures a home’s temperature, humidity, and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), which are harmful airborne irritants that come from everyday items like ​​paints and lacquers, cleaning supplies, pesticides, cosmetics, and building materials."
"Electricity production and heat add up to a quarter of all global emissions and, since almost every activity you can imagine requires electricity, cleaning up power grids has huge knock-on effects."
"The foothills of the Swiss Alps is a fitting location for a gravity energy storage startup: A short drive east from Energy Vault’s offices will take you to the Contra Dam, a concrete edifice made famous in the opening scene of GoldenEye, where James Bond bungee-jumps down the dam’s 220-meter-high face to infiltrate a top-secret Soviet chemical weapons facility."
"Water and height—Switzerland has both of these resources in abundance, which is why the country was an early pioneer of the oldest and most widely used large-scale energy storage on the planet: pumped hydro."
"When videoconferencing technology appeared in offices more than two decades ago, hybrid brainstorm sessions were for the most part a one-way conversation."
"Innovations in workplace technology don’t end with the conference room."
"Rulers from Mesopotamia to Manhattan have sought knowledge of the future in order to obtain strategic advantages—but time and again, they have failed to interpret it correctly, or they have failed to grasp either the political motives or the speculative limitations of those who proffer it."
"There is an assumption that the more scientific the approach to predictions, the more accurate forecasts will be."
"Since the earliest civilizations, the most important distinction in this practice has been between individuals who have an intrinsic gift or ability to predict the future, and systems that provide rules for calculating futures."
"At the same time, rather than depending on technological advances, other forecasters have turned to the strategy of crowdsourcing predictions of the future."
"Polling public and private opinions, for example, depends on something very simple—asking people what they intend to do or what they think will happen."
"Assembling a panel of experts to discuss a given topic, the thinking goes, is likely to be more accurate than individual prognostication."
"Reports in both the US and the UK, for example, stressed the significance of public health systems in responding effectively to a global crisis, but they did not convince either country to bolster their systems."
"A science for predicting the length of life carries with it a judgement of its value: that more life equates to better or more worthwhile life."
"When it comes to liability, we should be able to communicate the same model of liability applied to toys to the manufacturers of robot nannies: Make your robots reliable, describe what they do accurately, and provide sufficient notice of reasonably foreseeable danger from misuse."
"The failure of a small number of parents to adequately safeguard stairways or properly supervise their children using such products has resulted in injuries or deaths."
"No legislator wants to be associated with dead babies."
"No one has yet banned guns or automobiles, which are far more significant causes of child injury and death."
"Society needs to become more attentive to technology’s potential to improve the human condition rather than simply focusing on more immediate payoffs, like wealth and consumption."
"Robots are very different from television and dogs in that robots provide interactivity of a highly reliable sort."
"We know that a child’s ability to bond with parents has a long-term impact on their ability to form friendships, romantic relationships, and generally integrate with society."
"Of course, even if we discover correlations between children with a preference for interaction with AI and robots and the expression of other forms of introverted behavior, this does not mean that AI and robots are necessarily bad for these children."
"The United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child—which has been ratified by every nation in the world with the notable exception of the United States—enumerates certain basic human rights for each child."
"A primary right of this all-encompassing social, political, economic, and cultural treaty is the concept of a child’s agency and right to participation."
"Robotics and AI have already entered the domestic domain in the form of smartphones and AI assistants, and research reveals their impact on traditional family dynamics."
"Still, our goal must be that AI empowers not only the adults who love children, but the children themselves."
"Robots are manufactured devices that if they represent anything, represent the entities that develop and market them."
"When the last person left the moon in 1972, few could have predicted that humans wouldn’t return for another 50 years."
"We have to massively subsidize solar panels and electric cars. We have to bolster public transportation and redesign cities to discourage the use of cars."
"To date, only about a million people have had their whole genomes sequenced."
"Nuclear energy gets a bad rap in some American environmental circles and it’s not hard to see why."
"The United Nations is supposed to stick to more solid ground, but some of its Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 sound nearly as fantastical. In a mere 10 years, the UN plans to eradicate poverty “in all its forms everywhere.”"
"The good news is that crushing global poverty has declined significantly: The World Bank reports that 1.1 billion fewer people live in extreme poverty than did in 1990."
"The organization has been working with countries to improve education, gender equality, food security, social services, and more."
"But the gains are unevenly distributed, and climate change now threatens to undo much of the progress, pushing millions back into destitution and creating a “climate apartheid.”"
"Global losses from cybercrime totaled more than $1 trillion in 2020, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, double the amount from only two years before."
"“Our driving force is to ensure a customer’s data is where they need it to be, whether that’s due to customer preferences, regulatory requirements, or just ease of use,” says Lopes. “With every version of SQL Server, we want to give them the tools to gather and explore the data wherever they need it, all while keeping it safe.”"
"Organizations are inundated with torrents of data, which in turn create massive data sets that take an increasing amount of time and resources to analyze, even with advanced algorithms and processors."
"In the past, prolonging the life of a garment was the norm. Things were worn, cared for and fixed time and again."
"Currently however, it’s estimated that the average garment is worn only ten times before being disposed of, according to a leading clothes waste charity."
"Right now, of China’s 810,000 public charging points, more than 70 percent are in heavily populated coastal areas, such as Guangdong and Shanghai."
"Back then, China was aware it couldn’t match the West in internal combustion engine innovation, says Fengming Lu, a lecturer in the department of political and social change at the Australian National University."
"Today, not only does China produce the majority of the world’s EV batteries, it’s also forging ahead with the development and manufacturing of EVs—and selling them to the world."
"“Foreign auto brands were seen as the most desirable, but that’s different for electric vehicles,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has researched the Chinese EV industry."
"And local governments offer plenty of incentives: In some cities, EV owners pay less for license plates and can keep driving on days when conventional vehicles are restricted due to high air pollution."
"In 2009, China’s government enacted a series of policies to promote research and development and encourage state oil companies to invest in EV infrastructure."
"China’s interoperability gives it an advantage over other countries that are trying to encourage EV adoption, says Anders Hove, a Beijing-based researcher for the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies."
"Drivers can plug into any outlet and generally don’t need special cards or subscriptions, and they can pay with QR codes using common payment methods such as WeChat Pay or Alipay."
"The government has also heavily subsidized all aspects of the industry, including battery manufacturing. For example, from 2015 to 2019 automakers that manufacture cars in China were required to use batteries from a handful of white-listed domestic companies in order to be eligible for government subsidies, says Lu, a measure that helped create domestic battery giants like CATL and BYD."
"China’s two main state electric companies, State Grid and Southern Grid, maintain networks of high-speed charging stations along highways, while private companies generally install facilities within cities and villages."
"At some point, technology will become sophisticated enough to change DNA however desired."
"As a consequence, at this point it will be possible to actually design human beings."
"And blockchain is seen as a greatly disruptive technology that will take over numerous markets and industries in the future."
"Surely, plan A is to reduce global warming by changing the way we live, especially the way we produce and consume energy. However, there is a good chance that we will not succeed with plan A."
"Therefore, plan B is to adapt to the changing environment, increasing temperatures and more extreme weather phenomena. This poses a sheer endless list of yet unsolved problems. In fact, it is very realistic to assume that many countries will also fail with plan B."
"Genetic engineering or DNA technology is without doubt a rapidly growing field and will most likely open up mind-boggling possibilities in the future."
"Technologies like CRISPR will without doubt change the lives of millions of people for the better!"
"It is not at all unrealistic that a variety of genetic diseases will be cured by this technology."
"Also, personalized medicine will drastically advance to a point where drugs are individually adapted to a patient."
"It is not a new technique to genetically modify plants for an increased crop yield. In the future this trend will likely accelerate with possibly entirely new kinds of food or food produced in a lab (in vitro)."
"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our times, and we have not found a solution yet. Maybe, someday genetically modified plants will play its part in solving this too."
"Another objection is that it will be very hard to reach international consensus for such action."
"Even if all countries in the world would agree that geoengineering is necessary it would be very hard to agree on the details."
"In fact, we can expect to have much more knowledge very soon."
"Other technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing will drastically improve climate simulations."
"What Brain-Computer-Interfaces will make possible in the future definitely sounds like science fiction today."
"BCIs will allow humans to control computers and thus move objects only by thinking about it!"
"First off, there are a lot of beneficial use cases that will not immediately, drastically change our world."
"Another example, BCIs will soon be used in computer games."
"Computer mice for games become more and more complex, but the developers cannot put an infinite amount of buttons on them. So, controlling additional things in the game via thoughts can be the future here."
"I cannot wait for the time when I will only have to think about these lines and they will appear on my computer screen."
"Eventually, BCIs will revolutionize education."
"If the BCI serves as a source of input directly in the brain. This would literally enable humans to download information onto your own natural hard drive — your brain."
"You will not have to sit down and learn vocabulary for hours anymore. Instead, you will simply download the vocabulary via the BCI inserted in your brain and it will feel as if you have always known those vocabulary."
"You can google with your brain! Your brain essentially becomes the internet!"
"Having your brain connected to the internet would mean that you can text other people via thought. Or even talk to other people through that connection, without actually opening your mouth."
"If we think it through to the utmost extreme, you could not only share thoughts with anyone but also emotions or experiences and memories."
"Just implant for example a radio wave detector somewhere into the body and connect it with the BCI in the brain. The BCI will then feed the respective electrochemical signals to the natural part of the brain. The product would then be a human that can experience radio waves."
"Since we humans tend to think in linear ways, technology will always develop faster than we expect it."
"With solutions like this, the smart city has the potential to solve the worldwide issue of rapid population growth in urban areas."
"The concept “smart city” will affect the everyday life of billions of people and hopefully significantly improve their quality of life."
"Of course, entertainment is a huge field for AR to be applied. Movies and games can become much more immersive."
"At the time of writing hundreds of cities around the globe are about to implement their smart city programs."
"Despite all the difficulties, without doubt will the future’s cities become smarter. The positive aspects simply outweigh the problems that might occur along the way."
"Last but not least, chances are good that in the long-term augmented reality will change the regular office workplace."
"There is no doubt that augmented reality is here to stay."
"Just to get your imagination right, these weapons will never have a humanoid form."
"So, it is very likely that one day there will be weapons that are fully automated."
"This means that battles will be fought at a level and speed that humans cannot even comprehend anymore and certainly cannot control."
"Since so many influential people campaign against a global AI arms race, there is still a realistic chance for a future without fully automated weapons."
"So let us imagine future wars will be fought with AI supported weapons."
"As mentioned above, LAWs will not be expensive and will not require a lot of hardware. So once they are common to use for the military, criminals will get their hands on them too. And that is where it really becomes dangerous for the average citizen that might not even be involved in any criminal or military activity."
"All products will have become services. “I don't own anything. I don't own a car. I don't own a house. I don't own any appliances or any clothes,” writes Danish MP Ida Auken. Shopping is a distant memory in the city of 2030, whose inhabitants have cracked clean energy and borrow what they need on demand. It sounds utopian, until she mentions that her every move is tracked and outside the city live swathes of discontents, the ultimate depiction of a society split in two."
"There is a global price on carbon. China took the lead in 2017 with a market for trading the right to emit a tonne of CO2, setting the world on a path towards a single carbon price and a powerful incentive to ditch fossil fuels, predicts Jane Burston, Head of Climate and Environment at the UK’s National Physical Laboratory."
"US dominance is over. We have a handful of global powers. Nation states will have staged a comeback, writes Robert Muggah, Research Director at the Igarapé Institute. Instead of a single force, a handful of countries – the U.S., Russia, China, Germany, India and Japan chief among them – show semi-imperial tendencies. However, at the same time, the role of the state is threatened by trends including the rise of cities and the spread of online identities."
"Farewell hospital, hello home-spital. Technology will have further disrupted disease, writes Melanie Walker, a medical doctor and World Bank advisor. The hospital as we know it will be on its way out, with fewer accidents thanks to self-driving cars and great strides in preventive and personalised medicine. Scalpels and organ donors are out, tiny robotic tubes and bio-printed organs are in."
"We are eating much less meat. Rather like our grandparents, we will treat meat as a treat rather than a staple, writes Tim Benton, Professor of Population Ecology at the University of Leeds, UK. It won’t be big agriculture or little artisan producers that win, but rather a combination of the two, with convenience food redesigned to be healthier and less harmful to the environment."
"Today’s Syrian refugees, 2030’s CEOs. Highly educated Syrian refugees will have come of age by 2030, making the case for the economic integration of those who have been forced to flee conflict. The world needs to be better prepared for populations on the move, writes Lorna Solis, Founder and CEO of the NGO Blue Rose Compass, as climate change will have displaced 1 billion people."
"The values that built the West will have been tested to breaking point. We forget the checks and balances that bolster our democracies at our peril, writes Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch."
"“By the 2030s, we'll be ready to move humans toward the Red Planet.” What’s more, once we get there, we’ll probably discover evidence of alien life, writes Ellen Stofan, Chief Scientist at NASA. Big science will help us to answer big questions about life on earth, as well as opening up practical applications for space technology."
"Gender parity is good for everyone. When human capital is diverse, companies become more creative and productive—two qualities that will continue to be essential as economies today rebuild and restructure."
"The World Economic Forum is partnering with the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and over 50 global businesses to invest in innovative green technologies. These financing commitments will ensure new technologies are available for scale-up by 2030 and make a critical contribution to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050."
"If sufficient numbers of global companies commit certain proportions of their forward purchasing to green technologies in this decade, this will create a tipping point that accelerates their affordability and drives long-term, net-zero transformation across industrial value chains."
"Looking to the future, the direction of travel is clear. Digital ways of working will become ever more important as social innovators harness new ways to deliver their services, from smart healthcare to micro-finance and resources management."
"The Global Future Council on Mental Health envisions a future where digital technologies are a robust additional tool for providing mental health solutions to populations and geographies that would be difficult to access through traditional in-person care; where national mental health policies are supported by robust data on community needs and treatment outcomes; and where “mental wealth”, an approach that integrates the mental health of populations into measures of social and economic progress, becomes an important consideration in evaluating the prosperity of nations."
"Credit will become accessible to those ignored by traditional financial institutions"
"Web3 technologies will revolutionize the world of commerce"
"Physical and digital (phygital?) ‘things’ will be listed and traded on an open, liquid, digital market"
"With an explosion in internet penetration across the world accompanied by the proliferation of digital labour marketplaces or platforms, 'gig-work' is going to become the predominant mode of work."
"Soon, digital labour marketplaces will embed financial services into their products which will make credit accessible for many people who are ignored by traditional financial institutions."
"Over time, technology will enable financial stability and discipline without the need for people to gain relevant knowledge."
"AI and machine learning advisors will become ubiquitous, constantly recommending the next gig, next investment or next online class to us, truly democratizing growth and financial wellbeing."
"Just as decentralized finance’s ‘money lego’ applications have begun to unbundle traditional finance, an ecosystem of decentralized ‘commerce lego’ protocols and applications will evolve to create an open marketplace for things, where everyone can share in the value they create."
"The data industry will become more inclusive and affordable’"
"In the next few years, so long as governments allow it, we'll see technology in the data industry become more inclusive and affordable as startups enter the space."
"In the future, our focus will be on the human experience"
"The transition to the metaverse will be not a technological but a sociological paradigm shift."
"The metaverse will be shaped by the communication of our emotions, enabled by technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, and brain-computer interfaces. New hardware, platforms, disciplines, and senses will come into play."
"We'll redefine social contracts in the virtual world, where emotion, trust, and safety become our most important currencies."
"We'll decentralize the platform experience in favour of the human being."
"Battery powered construction will underpin sustainability efforts"
"Looking into the future, long-duration ESSs–which only need recharging weekly, monthly or longer–make off-site recharging from solar or wind farms a real possibility."
"The world is still figuring out the right technology base for long-duration ESSs, but there are multiple options: flow batteries, non-lithium-ion non-flow batteries, gravity-based ESSs, heat-based ESSs and hydrogen–and a winner, or winners are sure to emerge."
"Building will dynamically respond and adjust to support human wellness and comfort"
"Most building systems are still manually controlled, but in coming years, we'll see this status quo totally upended."
"Building will dynamically respond and adjust to support human wellness and comfort; minimize carbon emissions; and include building-to-building interoperability enabling true metaverse applications for the built environment."
"Grid flexibility will phase out fossil fuels and jumpstart the clean energy transition"
"Unlocking a significantly more digitized, decarbonized and resource efficient future by 2025 will be made possible by market-driven software solutions that allow smart energy technologies, such as EV chargers and heat pumps, to respond to real-time grid requirements in targeted areas, optimizing the asset owner's earnings as well as supporting the electric grid when it needs it most."
"People will eat more nourishing food"
"Good news is in the wind: thanks in part to new processing methods for healthy sugar or salt alternatives, good food will become an accessible, ubiquitous option for all consumers."
"People will eat more nourishing food even if in some cases they do not realize it – because cost and taste will be at par with less healthy, legacy foods."
"In the best of cases, production assets for questionable food ingredients (e.g., high-fructose corn syrup) will be redeployed for healthy counterparts."
"Finally, in a virtuous circle, global reductions in diet-related healthcare costs will have a deflationary effect on food prices, and global alleviation of health-related suffering will free individuals for inspired innovations that benefit humankind and the earth."
"Central bank digital currency will revolutionize the financial system"
"When underpinned with blockchain technology, a CBDC has the potential to revolutionize the financial system and pave the way to increasing financial inclusion and improving the lives of billions of people globally by providing access to cheap and affordable financial services."
"All these features when taken together will foster financial inclusion of the user by providing them with a digital alternative to physical cash, enhancing access to their money even in remote areas, and providing options for those that are currently unbanked."
"Innovative payment platforms will provide an on-ramp for building CBDC and bridging them together to existing payment networks, including both traditional banking and alternative finance. For banks and issuers, they’ll be able to integrate their existing infrastructure and be able to provide a broad spectrum of CBDC-linked payment-related services and exercise cross-chain interoperability protocols for universal payment access to digital national currencies, stablecoins, NFTs, the Metaverse and much more."
"Supply chain intelligence will solve the food crisis"
"By 2027, major food, beverage, and consumer packaged goods manufacturers will use AI-driven supply chain technology to see future disruption and act before weather, labour issues, and other incidents can harm the global food supply."
"Contingency plans will be needed far less often because companies will have advanced insights exposing how future weather events will impact their suppliers, giving them ample time to find alternatives. They will predict spikes in commodity availability, change their purchasing habits and reformulate their products so shelves remain stocked."
"Food spoilage and waste during transit will no longer be a problem because manufacturers and shippers can spot unusual weather, labour issues, and other stoppages well in advance. Food distribution to remote locations that need it the most will no longer be delayed due to port and road closures."
"Predictive supply chain technology will enable companies to shift from reactive response to proactive action, keeping store shelves stocked and food flowing worldwide."
"AI will reinvent how we think about education"
"AI will be used to understand children’s own interests to suggest the next step in their learning journey. AI will also generate insights for their parents and teachers and will turn them into mentors."
"Every child will be able to ideate, prototype, test and iterate in a cost-effective way. In this way, they will innovate and improve the well-being of the world."
"Technology will bring the best opportunities to the best talent"
"So, if I had to be provocative, I would say that technology is going to be a true leveller. It will bring the best opportunities to the best talent irrespective of where they live thereby truly unlocking the full potential of a billion knowledge workers."
"Advanced manufacturing and fashion technology could digitally transform the apparel industry"
"The quantum internet is coming, and it will revolutionize the world just as the classical internet has."

"Distributed quantum sensing will enable ultra-high-resolution telescopes, as well as ultra-precise clocks and GPS."
"And to make the power of quantum computing useful, clustered quantum computing and ultimately distributed quantum computing will enable the quantum internet."
"By 2027, AI will power clinical decision making in fertility clinics around the globe, enabling physicians to deliver a new level of precision medicine to improve outcomes and expand access for patients."
"Between now and 2030, over one billion people will suffer from infertility."
"As global population growth slows and drops below the replacement rate, utilizing AI-enhanced fertility treatments will help support the creation of new families and future generations."
"The use of technology and advanced analytics to support this decision making will lead to improvements in care efficiency, clinical success rates, and personalization of treatment methods."
"Ultimately, the impact will be a future with radically more efficient markets that free up massive amounts of wasted human potential to be re-directed toward more meaningful objectives."
"Remote sensing data streams will accurately monitor natural ecosystems."
"These data sources, combined with cloud data processing, artificial intelligence and data fusion will empower accurate measurement and monitoring of plant health and carbon sequestration potential for natural ecosystems."
"We're winning the fight against climate change - welcome to CO-topia."
"By 2030 your CO2 emissions will be far down. The air you breathe is cleaner. Nature is recovering. Saving the climate does involve huge change, but it might make us happier at the same time."
"After a decade of interventions, of activists and policy-makers fighting side by side, clean air is recognized as a basic human right and cities like Delhi see blue skies throughout the year."
"Accelerated in part by the long-term shutdown of international and regional travel by COVID-19, companies that design and build products will rapidly adopt cloud-based technologies to aggregate, intelligently transform, and contextually present product and process data from manufacturing lines throughout their supply chains."
"By 2025, this ubiquitous stream of data and the intelligent algorithms crunching it will enable manufacturing lines to continuously optimize towards higher levels of output and product quality – reducing overall waste in manufacturing by up to 50%."
"As a result, we will enjoy higher quality products, produced faster, at lower cost to our pocketbooks and the environment."
"In 2025, carbon footprints will be viewed as socially unacceptable, much like drink driving is today."
"The COVID-19 pandemic will have focused the public’s attention on the need to take action to deal with threats to our way of life, our health and our future."
"Public attention will drive government policy and behavioural changes, with carbon footprints becoming a subject of worldwide scrutiny."
"Individuals, companies and countries will seek the quickest and most affordable ways to achieve net-zero – the elimination of their carbon footprint."
"The creation of a sustainable, net-zero future will be built through a far-reaching energy transformation that significantly reduces the world’s carbon emissions, and through the emergence of a massive carbon management industry that captures, utilizes and eliminates carbon dioxide."
"We’ll see a diversity of new technologies aimed at both reducing and removing the world’s emissions – unleashing a wave of innovation to compare with the industrial and digital Revolutions of the past."
"By 2025, quantum computing will have outgrown its infancy, and a first generation of commercial devices will be able tackle meaningful, real-world problems."
"One major application of this new kind of computer will be the simulation of complex chemical reactions, a powerful tool that opens up new avenues in drug development."

"After the pandemic of 2020, consumers will be more aware of the importance of their underlying health and will increasingly demand healthier food to help support their natural defences."
"5G will enhance the global economy and save lives."
"With 5G networks in place, tied directly into autonomous bots, goods would be delivered safely within hours."
"In tomorrow’s world, cancer will be managed like any chronic health condition —we will be able to precisely identify what we may be facing and be empowered to overcome it."
"In other words, a new normal will emerge in how we can manage cancer."
"We will see more early and proactive screening with improved diagnostics innovation, such as in better genome sequencing technology or in liquid biopsy, that promises higher ease of testing, higher accuracy and ideally at an affordable cost."
"Early detection and intervention in common cancer types will not only save lives but reduce the financial and emotional burden of late discovery."
"We will also see a revolution in treatment propelled by technology."
"With the use of a new robotics application called 'microfulfillment', Grocery retailing will no longer look the same."
"The use of robotics downstream at a 'hyper local' level (as opposed to the traditional upstream application in the supply chain) will disrupt this 100-year-old, $5 trillion industry and all its stakeholders will experience significant change."
"Retailers will operate at a higher order of magnitude on productivity, which will in turn result in positive and enticing returns in the online grocery business (unheard of at the moment)."
"In the next few years we can expect to see this progress accelerate, with AI technology built to connect people at a human level and drive them closer to each other, even when physically they’re apart."
"The line between physical space and virtual will forever be blurred."
"We’ll start to see capabilities for global events - from SXSW to the Glastonbury Festival - to provide fully digitalized alternatives, beyond simple live streaming into full experiences."
"However, it’s not as simple as just providing these services - data privacy will have to be prioritised in order to create confidence among consumers."
"By 2025, the lines separating culture, information technology and health will be blurred."
"Engineering biology, machine learning and the sharing economy will establish a framework for decentralising the healthcare continuum, moving it from institutions to the individual."
"Propelling this forward are advances in artificial intelligence and new supply chain delivery mechanisms, which require the real-time biological data that engineering biology will deliver as simple, low-cost diagnostic tests to individuals in every corner of the globe. As a result, morbidity, mortality and costs will decrease in acute conditions, such as infectious diseases, because only the most severe cases will need additional care."
"Fewer infected people will leave their homes, dramatically altering disease epidemiology while decreasing the burden on healthcare systems."
"Inextricable links between health, socio-economic status and quality of life will begin to loosen, and tensions that exist by equating health with access to healthcare institutions will dissipate."
"From daily care to pandemics, these converging technologies will alter economic and social factors to relieve many pressures on the global human condition."
"Construction will become a synchronized sequence of manufacturing processes, delivering control, change and production at scale. It will be a safer, faster and more cost-effective way to build the homes, offices, factories and other structures we need to thrive in cities and beyond."
"Gigaton-scale CO2 removal will help to reverse climate change."
"A scale up of negative emission technologies, such as carbon dioxide removal, will remove climate-relevant amounts of CO2 from the air."
"While humanity will do everything possible to stop emitting more carbon into the atmosphere, it will also do everything it can in order to remove historic CO2 from the air permanently."
"By becoming widely accessible, the demand for CO2 removal will increase and costs will fall."
"CO2 removal will be scaled up to the gigaton-level, and will become the responsible option for removing unavoidable emissions from the air. It will empower individuals to have a direct and climate-positive impact on the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. It will ultimately help to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels and give humanity the potential to reverse climate change."
"AI is that new tool that will enable us to extract more insights at an unprecedented level from all the medical 'big data' that has never really been fully taken advantage of in the past. It will shift the world of medicine and how it is practiced."
"Improvements in AI will finally put access to wealth creation within reach of the masses."
"Artificial intelligence is improving at such a speed that the strategies employed by these financial advisors will be accessible via technology, and therefore affordable for the masses."
"Just like you don’t need to know how near-field communication works to use ApplePay, tens of millions of people won’t have to know modern portfolio theory to be able to have their money work for them."
"Over the next five years, the energy transition will reach a tipping point."
"The cost of new-build renewable energy will be lower than the marginal cost of fossil fuels."
"A global innovation ecosystem will have provided an environment in which problems can be addressed collectively, and allowed for the deployment of innovation to be scaled rapidly."
"As a result, we will have seen an astounding increase in offshore wind capacity."
"We will have achieved this through an unwavering commitment to digitalization, which will have gathered a pace that aligns with Moore’s law to mirror solar’s innovation curve."
"The rapid development of digital twins - virtual replicas of physical devices - will support a systems-level transformation of the energy sector."
"The scientific machine learning that combines physics-based models with big data will lead to leaner designs, lower operating costs and ultimately clean, affordable energy for all."
"The ability to monitor structural health in real-time and fix things before they break will result in safer, more resilient infrastructure and everything from wind farms to bridges and unmanned aerial vehicles being protected by a real-time digital twin."
"Every surface on Earth carries hidden information that will prove essential for avoiding pandemic-related crises, both now and in the future."
"Technology that accelerates our ability to rapidly sample, digitalize and interpret microbiome data will transform our understanding of how pathogens spread. Exposing this invisible microbiome data layer will identify genetic signatures that can predict when and where people and groups are shedding pathogens, which surfaces and environments present the highest transmission risk, and how these risks are impacted by our actions and change over time."
"We are just scratching the surface of what microbiome data insights offer and will see this accelerate over the next five years. These insights will not only help us avoid and respond to pandemics, but will influence how we design, operate and clean environments like buildings, cars, subways and planes, in addition to how we support economic activity without sacrificing public health."
"Over the next five years, carbon-heavy industries will use machine learning and AI technology to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint."
"Indeed, as a result of increasing digital transformation, carbon-heavy sectors will be able to utilize advanced technologies, like AI and machine learning, using real-time, high-fidelity data from billions of connected devices to efficiently and proactively reduce harmful emissions and decrease carbon footprints."
"Five years from now, privacy and data-centric security will have reached commodity status – and the ability for consumers to protect and control sensitive data assets will be viewed as the rule rather than the exception."
"As awareness and understanding continue to build, so will the prevalence of privacy preserving and enhancing capabilities, namely privacy-enhancing technologies (PET). By 2025, PET as a technology category will become mainstream."
"While the world will still lack a global privacy standard, organizations will embrace a data-centric approach to security that provides the flexibility necessary to adapt to regional regulations and consumer expectations."
"These efforts will be led by cross-functional teams representing the data, privacy and security interests within an organization."
"The next five years will see profound improvements in addressing these challenges as entrepreneurs, the investment community and the world’s largest enterprise R&D organizations focus on developing and deploying solutions that will deliver tangible results."
"With human rights groups like Amnesty International putting a spotlight on this issue, along with the rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and increased calls for stakeholder capitalism, we predict that there will be more progress in responsible investing in tech – especially in the venture capital space – in the coming years."
"The Chinese government released a document in August 2021 stating that authorities will actively promote legislation in areas such as national security, technology innovation and anti-monopoly."
"We predict that future regulations will be more targeted towards specific technologies, industries, use cases, risk profiles and affected communities."
"As technology ethics issues continue to permeate public awareness, we predict that most universities will offer more courses on technology ethics and make them compulsory for students to graduate with degrees in technical fields."
"With new technologies permeating more and more of our daily lives, the field of responsible technology is expanding."
"As the world becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, it is a holistic and multi-pronged approach to governance that will enable communities to experience the benefits and avoid the harms of these new technologies."
"Instead of deurbanization, the next decades will see cities forging powerful international partnerships and taking the lead in solving global problems."
"In 2020, we will witness the coming of age of the first cohorts of the Generation C (“C” for connected) that have lived their entire lives surrounded by the digital world."
"By then, the four horsemen of the Fourth Industrial Revolution – automation, augmented reality, cloud computing, and ambient intelligence – will have ushered in Industry 4.0 in all its digital splendor."
"Together with the steady retreat of the baby boomers, the advent of the digital age will be reason enough for Generation C and the Millennials to reinvent both how and where they work."
"With each incremental improvement in connectivity brought by digitization, the labor force – just like work itself – will become increasingly mobile."
"Digitization will also ensure that the very meaning of mobility will change."
"Indeed, Generation C will be the first cohort of workers to be mobile on their own terms, moving freely where others before them relocated out of necessity."
"At the same time, digitization will continue reshaping the contours of productivity at large. Most importantly, it will continue increasing the benefits of clustering in major sectors, such as manufacturing, financial services, and hospitality."
"Key among the entrepreneurs, who will inhabit and prosper in these clusters, will be “micro-multinationals” using digital platforms such as eBay, Alibaba, and Amazon to leap across geographical divides."
"As a result, the gravitational pull of cities will only grow stronger."
"The capacity of cities to create unprecedented levels of economic activity and innovation will all but ensure that they will take the lead in the century ahead."
"From a skills perspective, they will need to learn to more quickly anticipate these new consumer values, to translate them into product offerings and to become ever more knowledgeable about the processes involved in meeting these demands and the impact this may have on their employees’ current skill sets and working practices."
"However, along with the impact of disruptive changes on these sectors, it is anticipated that complex problem solving skills will become somewhat less important in industries that are heavily technical today—such as Basic and Infrastructure and Energy—in which technology may automate and take on a bigger part of these complex tasks going forward, and will ascend in those industries, such as Professional Services and Information and Communication Technology, that are expected to become more complex and analytical due to these trends."
"In the Consumer sector, for example, vast amounts of data will allow for increased sophistication in inventory management, customer segmentation and product personalization, involving some use and familiarity with technology by jobs at all levels, from retail assistant through to more senior positions."
"Overall, social skills—such as persuasion, emotional intelligence and teaching others—will be in higher demand across industries than narrow technical skills, such as programming or equipment operation and control."
"As noted earlier, in the face of rapidly rising computing power, an ability to work with data and make data-based decisions will become an increasingly vital skill across many job families as employers scramble to build a workforce with solid skills in data analysis and presentation (e.g. through visualization) and the amount of potentially useful digital information generated and stored keeps increasing exponentially."
"On average, by 2020, more than a third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations will be comprised of skills that are not yet considered crucial to the job today, according to our respondents."
"ital platforms will enable unforeseen levels of accountability, access, and openness, forever changing how local governments interact with the people they govern."
"Indeed, the time when governments see us as customers rather than citizens may be closer than we imagine."
"Content skills (which include ICT literacy and active learning), cognitive abilities (such as creativity and mathematical reasoning) and process skills (such as active listening and critical thinking) will be a growing part of the core skills requirements for many industries."
"For example, the increasing ubiquity of mobile internet combined with the coming-of-age of the Internet of Things promises to transform the daily routine of many frontline roles in the Sales and Related, Installation and Maintenance, and Manufacturing and Production job families across all industries, requiring a much higher level of technology literacy than in the past."
"As an ancillary characteristic to increased automation in these fields, employees are expected to have more responsibilities related to equipment control and maintenance and problem-solving skills, as well as a broader general understanding of the work processes of their company or organization."
"Many formerly purely technical occupations are expected to show a new demand for creative and interpersonal skills."
"For healthcare practitioners, for example, technological innovations will allow for increasing automation of diagnosis and personalization of treatments, redefining many medical roles towards translating and communicating this data effectively to patients."
"Similarly, Sales and Related jobs may see an increased demand for creative skills and ideas for promoting a memorable shopping experience, as brick-and-mortar retail has to reposition itself in relation to e-commerce and online competition."
"Overall, our respondents anticipate that a wide range of occupations will require a higher degree of cognitive abilities—such as creativity, logical reasoning and problem sensitivity—as part of their core skill set."
"At the other end of the scale, among all jobs requiring physical abilities less than one third (31%) are expected to have a growing demand for these in the future, about as many as the proportion of jobs in which physical abilities are anticipated to decline in importance (27%)."
"The skills bundle with the most stable demand across all jobs requiring these skills today or in the future are technical skills: nearly half (44%) of all jobs requiring these skills today will have a stable need for them in the coming years."
"What we have found instead is that disruptive changes will have a significant impact on skills requirements in all job families and that they are creating a range of opportunities and challenges in all industries, not just narrowly related to ‘hard knowledge’, technical skills and technology."
"Increased collaboration between stakeholders such as online talent platforms, human resources consulting firms, employers, policymakers, labour unions and education providers, has the potential to substantially improve the speed and precision of future workforce planning and managing organizational change."
"As the Fourth Industrial Revolution takes hold in different industries and job families, it will affect female and male workers in distinct ways."
"In short, as industries prepare to adapt to disruptive change the dynamics of the industry gender gap will be at the centre of many facets of the new employment landscape."
"According to a March 2022 industry report, the global market for home security is expected to rise from $2.9 billion in 2019 to an estimated $12.8 billion in 2026, driven by a rise in Internet of Things (IoT) technology and growing anxiety about broader safety concerns."
"Going forward, home safety will continue to be a top priority for homeowners."
"Finding green energy when the winds are calm and the skies are cloudy has been a challenge. Storing it in giant concrete blocks could be the answer."
"Storing energy in this way could help solve the biggest problem facing the transition to renewable electricity: finding a zero-carbon way to keep the lights on when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining."
"If our electricity gets greener, so do our homes, industries, and transport systems. This will become even more critical as more parts of our lives become electrified— particularly heating and transport, which will be difficult to decarbonize in any other way. All of this electrification is expected to double electricity production by 2050 according to the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"According to a recent industry report drawing on interviews with 100 executives around the world, nine out of ten businesses will be combining on-site and remote work going forward, yet companies still struggle with how to keep employees in both places connected."
"Going forward, companies need tools that make collaborating from anywhere a seamless experience, and one company is leading the way: Logitech."
"“At a football game, for instance, there isn’t one camera that stays stationary. Instead, there are multiple cameras that move around while offering data, so you’ve always got the best angle and the latest statistics. Because of that, some might say watching the big game at home is the better experience. And that’s what we’re applying to offices for the future of hybrid work: smart technology that eventually makes the remote meeting experience even better than being in the room.”"
"IF YOU COULD predict your death, would you want to? For most of human history, the answer has been a qualified yes."
"Robotics companies will want to be in the same position, as no company will want to be liable for damage to children, so it is likely that manufacturers will undersell the artificial intelligence (AI) and interactive capacities of their robots. It is therefore likely that any robots (and certainly those in jurisdictions with strong consumer protection) will be marketed primarily as toys, surveillance devices, and possibly household utilities. They will be brightly colored and deliberately designed to appeal to parents and children."
"But robots will always have disclaimers, such as “this device is not a toy and should only be used with adult supervision” or “this device is provided for entertainment only. It should not be considered educational.”"
"Parents will quickly notice the educational benefits of robot nannies that have advanced AI and communication skills."
"This will likely continue until or unless the incidence of injuries necessitates redesign, a revision of consumer safety standards, statutory notice requirements, and/or risk-based uninsurability, all of which will further refine the industry."
"Meanwhile, the media will also seize on stories of robots saving children in unexpected ways, as it does now when children (or adults) are saved by other young children and dogs."
"What robotics manufacturers will need to worry about is that robots will be banned due to incredibly rare cases of neglect or misuse, as with extremely popular children’s toys such as assisted walkers and lawn darts."
"Nurseries may be able to support more children, and more people could be attracted to the field or prove competent in it with the addition of AI assistance."
"Robots may therefore increase the probability that children develop bonding issues with their parents and friends. Some children will prefer the more reliable style of interactions they find with machines—just as some prefer simpler interactions with animals or the high-bandwidth, low-risk stimulation of books."
"Our concern is that children who prefer the predictable interactions with robots may be setting themselves up for a life-long preference for machines over humans."
"Gauging the individual capability of each child to engage in certain activities may be augmented as it is now by technology, but it will remain a parental duty."
"For example, it will be more difficult to protect or restrict children from perceived danger if a child can use their AI to present empirical data to the contrary."
"As children mature and grow in their understanding of AI and robotics, we can expect they may convert these devices into personalized legal and advocacy tools."
"We believe it is unlikely that robots will cause significant psychological damage."
"The bottom line is that the robots themselves will not love our children."
"And as with many far less engaging toys, we must always remember that children will love their robots."
"The companies that succeed in this new era will be the ones that understand how multiple data points come together to provide new insight, and that’s achieved with a database management system that offers speed and flexibility to adapt to any need."
"In the future, companies will need to predict and adjust to changing market dynamics and social shifts at an increasing rate to stay competitive."
"But NASA says this time around things will be different. The agency is planning a crewed mission to the moon in 2024, and this time it wants to stick around. The idea of the Artemis mission is to lay the foundation for a permanent human presence on and around the moon, which will then serve as a jump-off point for the agency’s journey to Mars."
"In October 2018 the UN warned that humanity has 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change. That means that by 2030, we’ll need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions in half, not so much a tall order as a towering one, given that emissions are still rising year to year."
"The next decade will see a more than hundredfold boom in the world’s output of human genetic data."
"Bigger samples will also make it possible to forecast even complex traits—like height or susceptibility to heart disease—from DNA."
"A world so saturated with genetic data will come with its own risks. The emergence of genetic surveillance states and the end of genetic privacy loom."
"Instead, expect to see small nuclear reactors start popping up."
"The first small reactors, developed by a company called NuScale Power, should start splitting atoms at Idaho National Laboratories in 2026."
"The 1900 edition of Ladies’ Home Journal predicted that, within the century, pneumatic tubes would deliver goods to homes and the letters C, X, and Q would drop out of the alphabet."
"Death prediction may be useful for early detection of disease, but in the end, it will never be able to measure the value of life."
"We once rubbed sticks together to make fire and lived in feral chaos; soon, we will travel in inter-dimensional spacecraft and eliminate mass suffering."
"At launch, the Home Hub will allow you to control Samsung’s smart appliances, including its Family Hub refrigerator, Bespoke Washer and Dryer, and Bespoke AirDresser."
