When the impact happens,  it'll actually be not far from 'noon' local time there, with the sun shining down almost from "directly above."
"After that,  it'll again be too close to the sun to observe from Earth."
We'll need (and I am confident will get) more observations in early February to refine the prediction; that will bring the "uncertainty down greatly."
After that, we'll probably not get any more data until sometime after the impact on March 4, if the lunar orbiting "satellites can image the resulting crater."

"It is not at all unrealistic that a variety of genetic diseases will be cured by this technology."
"Also, personalized medicine will drastically advance to a point where drugs are individually adapted to a patient."
It is not a new technique to genetically modify plants for an increased crop yield. In the future this trend will likely "accelerate with possibly entirely new kinds of food or food produced in a lab (in vitro)."
Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our times, and we have not found a solution yet. Maybe, someday "genetically modified plants will play its part in solving this too."
"Another objection is that it will be very hard to reach international consensus for such action."
Even if all countries in the world would agree that geoengineering is necessary it would be very hard to agree on the "details."

"There is no doubt that augmented reality is here to stay."
"Just to get your imagination right, these weapons will never have a humanoid form."
"So, it is very likely that one day there will be weapons that are fully automated."
This means that battles will be fought at a level and speed that humans cannot even comprehend anymore and certainly "cannot control."
Since so many influential people campaign against a global AI arms race, there is still a realistic chance for a future "without fully automated weapons."
"So let us imagine future wars will be fought with AI supported weapons."

"In other words, a new normal will emerge in how we can manage cancer."
We will see more early and proactive screening with improved diagnostics innovation, such as in better genome sequencing "technology or in liquid biopsy, that promises higher ease of testing, higher accuracy and ideally at an affordable cost."
Early detection and intervention in common cancer types will not only save lives but reduce the financial and emotional "burden of late discovery."
"We will also see a revolution in treatment propelled by technology."
"With the use of a new robotics application called 'microfulfillment', Grocery retailing will no longer look the same."
The use of robotics downstream at a 'hyper local' level (as opposed to the traditional upstream application in the supply "chain) will disrupt this 100-year-old, $5 trillion industry and all its stakeholders will experience significant change."
Retailers will operate at a higher order of magnitude on productivity, which will in turn result in positive and enticing "returns in the online grocery business (unheard of at the moment)."
In the next few years we can expect to see this progress accelerate, with AI technology built to connect people at a human "level and drive them closer to each other, even when physically they’re apart."
"The line between physical space and virtual will forever be blurred."
We’ll start to see capabilities for global events - from SXSW to the Glastonbury Festival - to provide fully digitalized "alternatives, beyond simple live streaming into full experiences."

"By 2025, the lines separating culture, information technology and health will be blurred."
"Gigaton-scale CO2 removal will help to reverse climate change."
A scale up of negative emission technologies, such as carbon dioxide removal, will remove climate-relevant amounts of CO2 "from the air."
"By becoming widely accessible, the demand for CO2 removal will increase and costs will fall."
CO2 removal will be scaled up to the gigaton-level, and will become the responsible option for removing unavoidable emissions from the air. It will empower individuals to have a direct and climate-positive impact on the level of CO2 in the atmosphere. It will ultimately help to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels and give humanity the "potential to reverse climate change."
"Improvements in AI will finally put access to wealth creation within reach of the masses."
Artificial intelligence is improving at such a speed that the strategies employed by these financial advisors will be "accessible via technology, and therefore affordable for the masses."

"Over the next five years, the energy transition will reach a tipping point."
"The cost of new-build renewable energy will be lower than the marginal cost of fossil fuels."
A global innovation ecosystem will have provided an environment in which problems can be addressed collectively, and "allowed for the deployment of innovation to be scaled rapidly."
"As a result, we will have seen an astounding increase in offshore wind capacity."
We will have achieved this through an unwavering commitment to digitalization, which will have gathered a pace that aligns "with Moore’s law to mirror solar’s innovation curve."
The rapid development of digital twins - virtual replicas of physical devices - will support a systems-level "transformation of the energy sector."
We are just scratching the surface of what microbiome data insights offer and will see this accelerate over the next five years. These insights will not only help us avoid and respond to pandemics, but will influence how we design, operate and clean environments like buildings, cars, subways and planes, in addition to how we support economic activity without "sacrificing public health."
Over the next five years, carbon-heavy industries will use machine learning and AI technology to dramatically reduce their "carbon footprint."
These efforts will be led by cross-functional teams representing the data, privacy and security interests within an "organization."
The next five years will see profound improvements in addressing these challenges as entrepreneurs, the investment community and the world’s largest enterprise R&D organizations focus on developing and deploying solutions that will "deliver tangible results."
With human rights groups like Amnesty International putting a spotlight on this issue, along with the rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and increased calls for stakeholder capitalism, we predict that there "will be more progress in responsible investing in tech – especially in the venture capital space – in the coming years."

"With new technologies permeating more and more of our daily lives, the field of responsible technology is expanding."
As the world becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, it is a holistic and multi-pronged approach to governance "that will enable communities to experience the benefits and avoid the harms of these new technologies."
Instead of deurbanization, the next decades will see cities forging powerful international partnerships and taking the "lead in solving global problems."
In 2020, we will witness the coming of age of the first cohorts of the Generation C (“C” for connected) that have lived "their entire lives surrounded by the digital world."
By then, the four horsemen of the Fourth Industrial Revolution – automation, augmented reality, cloud computing, and "ambient intelligence – will have ushered in Industry 4.0 in all its digital splendor."
Together with the steady retreat of the baby boomers, the advent of the digital age will be reason enough for Generation C "and the Millennials to reinvent both how and where they work."
With each incremental improvement in connectivity brought by digitization, the labor force – just like work itself – will "become increasingly mobile."
"Digitization will also ensure that the very meaning of mobility will change."
Indeed, Generation C will be the first cohort of workers to be mobile on their own terms, moving freely where others "before them relocated out of necessity."
At the same time, digitization will continue reshaping the contours of productivity at large. Most importantly, it will continue increasing the benefits of clustering in major sectors, such as manufacturing, financial services, and "hospitality."
Key among the entrepreneurs, who will inhabit and prosper in these clusters, will be “micro-multinationals” using digital "platforms such as eBay, Alibaba, and Amazon to leap across geographical divides."
"As a result, the gravitational pull of cities will only grow stronger."
"Going forward, home safety will continue to be a top priority for homeowners."
"IF YOU COULD predict your death, would you want to? For most of human history, the answer has been a qualified yes."
