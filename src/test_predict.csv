2|0|[0]|[0.02544864]|The current year has been no exception to that sad pattern and civilians continue to be the target of attacks: in Iraq, both Iraqi and foreign nationals have been targeted; in Madrid, an attack was perpetrated against a commuter train; and, in the Russian Federation, there have been a string of attacks, the latest being the school massacre in Beslan, where children fell victim to an unprecedented atrocity.
3|1|[0]|[0.07076553]|That is why it is already high time to address an urgent appeal to all peoples and men of goodwill to join their energies and bend all their will towards the achievement of justice and peace in the world.

13|0|[0]|[0.05494223]|Under those circumstances, it is worth recalling the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which were enunciated 50 years ago by Myanmar, along with China and India, to provide the basic principles for inter-State relations.

18|0|[0]|[0.02401362]|That was the subject of a 20 September meeting of more than 60 world leaders, who were resolved to tackle it with all the tools available to them.
19|0|[0]|[0.02177426]|The “lost decade” of the 1980s was the result of exactly the same problems, although there was also an international economic crisis and an absence of democratic 28  legitimacy in most of the continent at that time.
20|0|[0]|[0.02590696]|Democracy, as a system of government, ended up being conflated with the limitations of individuals, while in truth the problem was that Governments were unable to produce effective responses.

24|0|[0]|[0.03398434]|As a result, international interests have become interwoven and the distinction between local and international questions has almost vanished in light of the spread of globalization.
25|0|[0]|[0.03205014]|As reform and modernization of the United Nations have become a goal for the majority of its Members, by the same token, leaders and political experts in many parts of the world, including the Arab world, have become aware that reform and modernization are important issues in their societies in order to address the demands for change and the movement of history, and that these issues must be addressed with clear-sightedness and wisdom, to meet 25  the hopes and aspirations of the new generation for progress and democratization.

32|0|[0]|[0.03854849]|Many of us have been traumatized by terrorism, by the brutal acts of repression that are taking place in many parts of the world and by the tense situation and developments in Iraq.
33|0|[0]|[0.01814788]|The historic Millennium Summit of the United Nations, which brought together 189 nations in September 2000 and adopted the Millennium Declaration, was a clarion call for action to solve these problems and set forth the Millennium Development Goals with measurable goals and targets for combating them.
34|0|[0]|[0.02099533]|The past year for Chad, as for many African countries, was a year of serious concerns regarding the armed conflicts raging everywhere — conflicts that took peaceful populations hostage, destabilized our States and continued to jeopardize the joint efforts being made to establish democratic institutions and promote socio-economic progress.
35|0|[0]|[0.019875]|In addition, the task of adapting our legislation to national and international realities was imposed on our national representation meeting, which made a commitment on 26 May 2004, to a procedure aimed at amending some provisions of the Fundamental Law adopted by referendum on 31 March 1996.
36|0|[0]|[0.02759919]|Namibiaís protracted liberation struggle was bloody and bitter.

38|0|[0]|[0.03064533]|The mistakes committed during the world war on terror, regardless of whether they were committed in good faith or in bad faith, have worked as a call to promote and practice terrorism, which has been embraced by an enemy whose whereabouts we do not know.
39|0|[0]|[0.07431758]|It was hoping to achieve the following: first, to incite the Americans in particular and the West in general to wage endless wars in the Middle East, in order to underscore the old-new theory of Israel that the Arab- Israeli conflict is not the core of the problems of the region.
40|0|[0]|[0.03897963]|We feel that certain successes have been achieved through the adoption of political dialogue, and that it is essential to Iraq to expand that dialogue.
41|0|[0]|[0.03004948]|However, the results of the new developments have been an amalgamation of democracy and dictatorship, of human rights and enslavement, of great prosperity and extreme poverty, of the provision of advanced health care side by side with fatal contagious diseases, of free trade and world trade monopoly, and of a rise in the price of industrial products and a decline in the prices of the raw materials required to maintain their production.
42|0|[0]|[0.02178451]|The most recent inter- Arab initiative was launched by Arab private sector 12  and grass-roots civil organizations, with active Jordanian participation, in Amman on the margin of the World Economic Forum, which was convened at the Dead Sea last May.
43|0|[0]|[0.08089538]|The creation of the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and the great strides that have been taken in the past two years, are a clear indication that we are moving in the right direction.

51|0|[0]|[0.02164883]|Its ideals and founding purposes remain valid, but, as a number of speakers have noted here, the power structure upon which the Organization was built at its inception corresponds to a world that is very different from todayís world.
52|0|[0]|[0.01998233]|The signing of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi on 28 August 2000 was a decisive step forward in the peace process in my country, which since 1993 had been devastated by the longest crisis in its history, even jeopardizing the very existence of the nation.

485|1|[1]|[0.76850057]|However, along with the impact of disruptive changes on these sectors, it is anticipated that complex problem solving skills will become somewhat less important in industries that are heavily technical today—such as Basic and Infrastructure and Energy—in which technology may automate and take on a bigger part of these complex tasks going forward, and will ascend in those industries, such as Professional Services and Information and Communication Technology, that are expected to become more complex and analytical due to these trends.
486|1|[1]|[0.76799816]|In the Consumer sector, for example, vast amounts of data will allow for increased sophistication in inventory management, customer segmentation and product personalization, involving some use and familiarity with technology by jobs at all levels, from retail assistant through to more senior positions.
487|1|[0]|[0.20091699]|Similarly, Sales and Related jobs may see an increased demand for creative skills and ideas for promoting a memorable shopping experience, as brick-and-mortar retail has to reposition itself in relation to e-commerce and online competition.
488|1|[0]|[0.21692978]|Increased collaboration between stakeholders such as online talent platforms, human resources consulting firms, employers, policymakers, labour unions and education providers, has the potential to substantially improve the speed and precision of future workforce planning and managing organizational change.
489|1|[1]|[0.7857243]|If our electricity gets greener, so do our homes, industries, and transport systems. This will become even more critical as more parts of our lives become electrified— particularly heating and transport, which will be difficult to decarbonize in any other way. All of this electrification is expected to double electricity production by 2050 according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
490|1|[1]|[0.76484466]|According to a recent industry report drawing on interviews with 100 executives around the world, nine out of ten businesses will be combining on-site and remote work going forward, yet companies still struggle with how to keep employees in both places connected.
491|1|[0]|[0.25865397]|Going forward, companies need tools that make collaborating from anywhere a seamless experience, and one company is leading the way: Logitech.
492|1|[1]|[0.7798752]|Robotics companies will want to be in the same position, as no company will want to be liable for damage to children, so it is likely that manufacturers will undersell the artificial intelligence (AI) and interactive capacities of their robots. It is therefore likely that any robots (and certainly those in jurisdictions with strong consumer protection) will be marketed primarily as toys, surveillance devices, and possibly household utilities. They will be brightly colored and deliberately designed to appeal to parents and children.
493|1|[1]|[0.7780622]|Meanwhile, the media will also seize on stories of robots saving children in unexpected ways, as it does now when children (or adults) are saved by other young children and dogs.
494|1|[1]|[0.7805417]|What robotics manufacturers will need to worry about is that robots will be banned due to incredibly rare cases of neglect or misuse, as with extremely popular children’s toys such as assisted walkers and lawn darts.
495|1|[1]|[0.6980362]|As children mature and grow in their understanding of AI and robotics, we can expect they may convert these devices into personalized legal and advocacy tools.
496|1|[1]|[0.7475606]|We believe it is unlikely that robots will cause significant psychological damage.
497|1|[1]|[0.7727959]|In the future, companies will need to predict and adjust to changing market dynamics and social shifts at an increasing rate to stay competitive.
498|1|[1]|[0.7820076]|A world so saturated with genetic data will come with its own risks. The emergence of genetic surveillance states and the end of genetic privacy loom.
