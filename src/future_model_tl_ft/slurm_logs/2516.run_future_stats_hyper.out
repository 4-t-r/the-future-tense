The declaration by the Secretary-General on 20 September 1972 that 1974 will be observed as World Population Year is a cogent reminder that the earth's resources are limited and that population planning is indispensable to the preservation of the human species and the enhancement of the quality of life in the world.

Robotics companies will want to be in the same position, as no company will want to be liable for damage to children, so it is likely that manufacturers will undersell the artificial intelligence (AI) and interactive capacities of their robots. It is therefore likely that any robots (and certainly those in jurisdictions with strong consumer protection) will be marketed primarily as toys, surveillance devices, and possibly household utilities. They will be brightly colored and deliberately designed to appeal to parents and children.

It should not be considered educational.”
