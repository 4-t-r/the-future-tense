We in the developing countries of the Caribbean urgently need to develop our human stock and to widen the space of economic opportunity; to provide more of our young people with better education; to provide facilities that will keep our populations healthy and productive; to provide incomes that will encourage our people to save and to convert such savings into low- interest loans for productive enterprise; and to concentrate on exports and undertakings such as tourism to earn foreign exchange.
