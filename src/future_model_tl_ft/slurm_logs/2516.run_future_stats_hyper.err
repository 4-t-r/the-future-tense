2022-08-03 16:54:19.230336: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
Some layers from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing TFDistilBertModel: ['vocab_transform', 'activation_13', 'vocab_projector', 'vocab_layer_norm']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
All the layers of TFDistilBertModel were initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFDistilBertModel for predictions without further training.
