\subsection{Websites Examination}

As mentioned in Section XX, the Model Pipeline produces the final data set for the analysis of the AI statements. 
A constituent of this data set is the url from which a particular AI terms was sampled.
Table~\ref{Top-Domains} presents the domains that contain most of the statements in our final data set, which we derived from the urls of those.
The domain from which we retrieved the most testimonials is lesswrong.com
The site deals with phylosophical and gesitescientific questions on the topic of AI. 
Following this, as well as at the lower part of the list of the top 10 domains, are three sites from the field of gaming (acceleratingfuture.com, mugenguild.com, slightlymagic.net).
Two other pages catch attention in this list.
The first one is dodsbir.net, which deals with the research of defence and military needs (dodsbir.net).
A store with speech recognition devices is also available (knowbrainer.com).
At first glance, these sources appear relatively diversified
Nevertheless a number of scientific blogs on AI-related topics are also included. which are lead by researchers or from the tech industry.
Latter are mostly data scientists.
The proportion of such blogs among the main domains 10 corresponds to half.
Considering the other domains, many scientific websites as well as websites about gaming are also very abundant.
Thus, rather statements about the future of people from AI related fields are included.
This could mean that this topic has a lower role in the general population and thus it is dealt very little with AI-specific topics in the public society.
It would be interesting to observe what kind of domains would have appeared if data from the last few months were used.
More people might feel affected by the latest developments in this area.
Consequently, there could be more blogs with people from other sectors who would exchange opinions about these developments.
\\
Upon closer examination of the domains, we noticed that the content of the corresponding pages is not at all about AI technologies.
An example is basketbawful.blogspot.com. 
This blog does not contain information about technologies.
Nevertheless, a basketball player with the initials AI is often mentioned there.
http://allallergy.net is another page from which we mistakenly extracted sentences by applying the regex we previously defined. 
On this page alzheimer's illness is abbreviated as AI.
Accordingly, we removed any statements from such domains from our final data set created by the model pipeline.

\subsection{Project Limits}

Since we had a limited time for this project, there are some aspects where we would have liked to continue our work.
From a technical point of view, we would have preferred to spend additional time on labelling more data for the sentiment model.
Thus, it could have been possible to fine-tune this model as well.
With our current approach, we only keep the AI future predictions if the sentiment model makes a prediction with a certainty of more than 70\%. 
This results in the loss of a few additional statements that we would have available for analysis.
\\
Unfortunately, the location containing the corresponding date on the website does not contain the corresponding date is not consistent. 
Accordingly, we would have needed more time for the date extraction.
Providing a year for each statement could illustrate how the perception of a certain topic in the field of AI has changed over time.
Having insights about such trends, allows monitoring the developments in cultural perceptions over time periods.
