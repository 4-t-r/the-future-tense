\section{Discussion}
Since we had a limited time for this project, there are some aspects where we would have liked to continue our work.
From a technical point of view, we would have preferred to spend additional time on labelling more data for the sentiment model.
Thus, it could have been possible to fine-tune this model as well.
With our current approach, we only keep the AI future predictions if the sentiment model makes a prediction with a certainty of more than 70\%. 
This results in the loss of a few additional statements that we would have available for analysis.
\\
Unfortunately, the location containing the corresponding date on the website does not contain the corresponding date is not consistent. 
Accordingly, we would have needed more time for the date extraction.
Providing a year for each statement could illustrate how the perception of a certain topic in the field of AI has changed over time.
Having insights about such trends, allows monitoring the developments in cultural perceptions over time periods.
