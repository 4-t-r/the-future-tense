\section{Model Card: Future Statement Model}
This model is a finetuned on 2500 expressions, which contained 1250 future statements. distilbert-base-uncased serves as a base model

%
\textbf{Model Description}
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Huggingface name: distilbert-base-future
    \item Creation Date: 11/08/22
    \item Version: 1.0
    \item model type: text classification
\end{itemize}%
%
\textbf{Intended Use \& Limitations}
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item The primary intended use is the classification of input into a future or non-future sentence/statement.
    \item The model is primarily intended to be used by researchers to filter or label a large number of sentences according to the grammatical tense of the input.
\end{itemize}%
%
\textbf{Hyperparameters}
\\
\\
The following hyperparameters were used during training
\begin{itemize}
    \item optimizer:
    name: Adam, learning\_rate: 5e-05, decay: 0.0, beta\_1: 0.9, beta\_2: 0.999, epsilon: 1e-07, amsgrad: False
    \item training\_precision: float32
\end{itemize}%

\textbf{Training Results}
\\
For finetuning, we have 80\% of of records from our self-annotated future-tatements dataset. This corresponds to 2000 records.
The remaining 500 will be used to test the final distilbert-base-future model
