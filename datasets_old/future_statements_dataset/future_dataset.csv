When our Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, addressed this forum last year, he noted Australia was developing regional approaches to confront the dangers of State failure and that with our Pacific Islands Forum partners we were restoring hope to the people of Solomon Islands.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

The Secretary-General’s most recent effort to solve the Cyprus problem resulted in a plan that was described by some as a historic opportunity to solve one of the most long-standing international problems.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
First, the Annan Plan was not the product of negotiation, nor did it constitute an agreed solution between the parties.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
Secondly, the Plan did not place the necessary emphasis on achieving a one-State solution with a central Government able to guarantee the single, sovereign character of Cyprus.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
In rejecting the Plan as a settlement for the Cyprus problem, the Greek Cypriots did not reject the solution or the reunification of their country; they rejected this particular Plan as not effectively achieving that objective.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

A related reason was the lack of transparency and accountability in the management of State resources, especially from the forestry sector and the maritime programme.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The aim of the conference was to seek support for our two-year reconstruction plan.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
I am happy to report that, to date, $455 million of those pledges have been classified as firm commitments.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

As a result, millions of dollars have been removed from 11  circulation and hundreds of thousands of people the world over have been saved from narcotics dependency.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The Bolivian response to that crisis was issued peacefully, in respect for democracy, through a mechanism of constitutional succession that allowed me, as Vice-President, to take office as President and to assume the enormous challenges to the country in order to restore order, peace and the prospects and hopes of our society.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
Positive results allowed for macroeconomic stability, but genuinely inadequate results in the social sphere were the outcome primarily of exhaustion and the need for different responses.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
All of those historical arrears fell due in October, leading to a popular upheaval that ended in social turmoil, calling not only for a short- term response — ours, I believe, was effective in that democracy and peace were preserved — but also and above all for a forward-looking solution.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
One of the country’s key issues was the definition of an energy policy once we learned that our nation has one of the largest reserves of natural gas in South America.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
We chose a path that was difficult, yet attractive, and that marked our desire for democratic participation and participative democracy — please forgive the wordplay — within our society.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
We opted for a binding referendum in which the people of Bolivia were able to decide what they wished to do with their most important energy resources.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
It was successfully held on 18 July.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

The people of Venezuela were faced with such a decision last month, with a referendum on the presidency.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
In my country, by the late eighties, a set of structural adjustments, developed under the influence of the main centres of neo-liberal capitalism, was met with a popular uprising that paralysed the country, leaving an indelible mark on our people’s minds.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

That was a painfully tragic moment for the people of Venezuela.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
Wherever the architects of neo- liberalism gathered, they were met with massive protests in the streets.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

We are satisfied that the more rational approach that we are suggesting can solve many problems that have been in existence for generations.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

I repeat, without exaggeration, that Hurricane Ivan, in a few short hours, reduced Grenada to rubble and, at a stroke, undid the hard work and achievements of its people since independence in 1974.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

On 25 February 2004, CARICOM was successful in having the matter raised at a meeting of the Security Council.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The draft resolution presented by CARICOM to the Security Council was noted but politely ignored.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

Relations between India and Pakistan have been a matter of attention for the international community.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The promise of lasting peace presaged by the end of the cold war was destroyed by terrorist actions — actions which were condemned by all humankind and which have unleashed a steady escalation of violence that has turned the world into a place of uncertainty.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
We want to underscore the importance of a meeting that was held at the United Nations last week — the gathering of world leaders in an alliance against hunger and poverty, which resulted in a serious commitment on the part of each and every one of our representatives here to fight unwaveringly and effectively to achieve the agreed objectives.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

The first results of the high-level commission set up for this purpose by Secretary-General Kofi Annan were published last June.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
That campaign has as its only objective the justification of an absurd intervention by force in Equatorial Guinea — the failed multinational mercenary invasion that was to have taken place on 6 March last.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The international community is aware of the events connected to that aborted plan thanks to press reports on the trials, held simultaneously in Equatorial Guinea and in Zimbabwe, of those mercenaries who were arrested in Malabo and in Harare, respectively.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
Indeed, and under the pretext of supporting the political claims of a supposed opposition leader in exile in Spain, a number of mercenaries, of various nationalities but with a common leadership, acquired a cargo plane with the goal of transporting to Malabo, in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, 65 trained, armed men who were to take part in an invasion — a suicide operation.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
That group was to join up with those coming from Harare.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The support that they received from Spain was to involve the use of two Spanish Navy warships with 500 sailors on board, for support in case of resistance.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The goal was to put in power, at Government headquarters, Mr. Severo Moto Nsa, who had formed a government in exile that was recognized by the previous Government of Spain.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
Fortunately, the solidarity of the Governments of Angola, Zimbabwe and South Africa came into play and they alerted the security services of my country, which acted immediately, arresting, on the night of 6 March, the 18 men stationed in Malabo, while the Harare Government did the same with those found in that capital’s airport on 7 March 2004.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
They also gave details on the financing of the purchase of arms and of the cargo plane, and on the offer of the Spanish ships, which were already, at that time, anchored in the territorial waters of Equatorial Guinea.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
We know that the mercenaries have acted in other parts of the world, and we bring this to the General Assembly because of the destructive effects that have been seen in other affected countries.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
We speak of important issues, such as democracy, globalization, terrorism, poverty eradication, human development and the spread of infectious disease, as if they were completely disconnected.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
Although commitments have been made, the lethargic performance of many countries, including Vanuatu, demonstrate the need for more international support in assisting countries to meet those targets.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

As world leaders, we have time and again expressed serious concerns and dissatisfaction about the fact that certain decisions and actions by the United Nations or its bodies were not consistent with the purposes and intentions of the Charter.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The continuing disputes and concerns raised with regard to the legality of United Nations-endorsed instruments that have been concluded throughout the years — such as the New York Agreement of 1962, to govern the United Nations administration of the so- called Act of Free Choice in West Papua — is a clear example challenging the integrity and validity of United Nations resolutions at that time.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
In our opinion, the United Nations-conducted exercises were a total farce conditioned only to suit the geopolitical climate of that period.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
On a final matter, my delegation strongly reaffirms its support for resolution 2758 (XXVI), which was adopted during the twenty-sixth session, in 1971, and which recognized the legal and political representation of the People’s Republic of China as a Member of the United Nations.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
My Government was not properly consulted in that regard, and requests that the decision to relocate the Centre from Vanuatu be reconsidered.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
In the Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti and my own country, Jamaica, the loss of life and the scale of destruction and damage to infrastructure, property and means of livelihood have been catastrophic.|no|UN General Debates Corpus
The case of Grenada, which was virtually obliterated, is particularly striking.|no|UN General Debates Corpus

If we did discover a virus that would devastate the world if it crossed over into humans, someone might expose themselves accidentally while researching it, as has happened with smallpox and with influenzas.|yes|vox
All of the discovered genomes would be fully public, which is itself a response to legitimate previous concerns that viral discovery work involved the US going into poor countries and collecting data that the US then didn’t share with locals.|yes|vox

Right now, the cost of sending goods across the Pacific is still more expensive than it was before the pandemic. This price surge is a product of not only the delays and bottlenecks in the supply chain created by Covid-19 but also the huge increase in demand for consumer goods that followed.|no|vox
Today, the top nine companies control 85 percent of the trade. Go back 15 years ago, the top 10 companies controlled 50 percent of the trade.|no|vox
Meta is trying to transition away from its complicated legacy as a social media company to a futuristic metaverse vision that aims to reshape the future of the internet.|no|vox

The current anxiety about period apps is understandable, given the purpose that they serve.|no|vox
Since a draft opinion indicating that Roe would be reversed leaked in May, and period apps got more scrutiny than perhaps ever before, many of them have scrambled to assure users that their data is safe.|no|vox
People have been menstruating for as long as people have existed.|no|vox

The Verge recently published some good and clear advice.|no|vox
Germany’s decision to restart old coal plants rather than extend the life of its nuclear power facilities reflects a failure of environmental priorities.|no|vox
Zero-carbon sources of renewable energy like wind and solar have seen tremendous increases in capacity and equally impressive decreases in price in recent years, while the decades-old technology of hydropower is still what the International Energy Agency calls the “forgotten giant of low-carbon electricity”.|no|vox
Unlike solar or wind, nuclear plants aren’t intermittent, and they require significantly less land area per megawatt produced.|no|vox
With little natural gas supplies of the country’s own, and its heavily supported renewable sector unable to fully make up the shortfall, German leaders faced a dilemma.|no|vox

We’re battling a sleep loss epidemic.|no|vox
This is the first law of its kind in the US and it’s a big step in the right direction.|no|vox
It can be the result of insomnia, when you can’t fall asleep despite having the chance to do so, or sleep deprivation, when your schedule robs you of the opportunity.|no|vox
According to Gallup polling data from 2013, only 11 percent of us were sleeping six hours or less per night in 1942, but that figure had risen to 42 percent by 1990.|no|vox
Sleep loss is a huge problem because it may increase our risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and even early death.|no|vox
It can also cause a lot of emotional suffering, from loneliness to anxiety.|no|vox
Experts blame the sleep-loss epidemic on a number of factors, including longer work hours, longer commuting distances, immoderate alcohol and coffee consumption, insufficient sunlight during the day, and excessive artificial light at night.|no|vox
In many developed countries, the reigning cultural assumption is that sleeping very little means you’re hardworking, and sleeping a normal amount means you’re lazy.|no|vox
So do people who live in noisy neighborhoods and who work odd shifts.|no|vox
Feeling stressed or unsafe often translates into poor sleep because it signals the brain to stay vigilant.|no|vox

Consumer prices surged again in June, reaching a new four-decade high as many Americans are already feeling frustrated with higher costs denting their budgets.|no|vox
Nearly everything grew more expensive, but the price gains were mainly fueled by an increase in energy, food, and shelter costs, which have been climbing for months amid supply chain disruptions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.|no|vox
Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose an uncomfortably high 0.7 percent from May to June.|no|vox
Rapid inflation has posed a challenge for the White House and weighed down President Biden’s approval ratings ahead of this year’s midterm elections.|no|vox
The inflation numbers are bad.|no|vox
The jump in inflation is bad news for President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings are stubbornly low.|no|vox
Inflation peaked in June, given the volatility of energy prices.|no|vox
Energy alone comprised nearly half of the monthly increase in inflation.|no|vox
Forty years ago, the Fed pushed the economy into a recession to stop inflation.|no|vox

The $200 million program was tasked with building other countries’ capabilities to detect new viruses and manage outbreaks, studying the human-wildlife interface and learning about how viruses cross over into humans.|no|vox
But after a little more than a decade, the program’s funding was cut off by the Trump administration in October 2019.|no|vox
And in the years since Predict launched, the conversation on the value of viral discovery has shifted toward even greater pessimism.|no|vox
But if the risks of virus hunting are higher than the odds of a virus crossing over into humans and sparking a pandemic naturally, then viral discovery doesn’t just look inefficient.|no|vox
Before the pandemic, the dominant paradigm was that if we could find these threats we could predict and prevent.|no|vox
Not much has come of the viral discovery elements of Predict.|no|vox
Much pandemic prevention work has focused on minimizing human-animal interfaces.|no|vox
Virus hunting itself frequently involves exposure to the highest-risk human-animal interfaces.|no|vox
Developing effective bioweapons is difficult — but the hard part isn’t the doing, it’s identifying the rare one that is contagious and dangerous to human beings.|no|vox

The only problem is that as many , many  publications have noted, including the New York Times Magazine in a recent piece , it's nearly impossible to overdose from merely touching fentanyl, or any other drug from that matter, because it couldn't enter the bloodstream or cross the 'blood-brain barrier' as quickly as these videos depict.|no|
One could be forgiven for presuming most of these cops are faking their symptoms for YouTube views, which is a predominant belief  among the police-critical , comparing it to the mysterious and widely-disbelieved Havana Syndrome phenomenon said to be suffered by CIA and other intelligence agents.|no|
But as it turns out, they may not necessarily be faking it at all.|no|

This week, GameStop launched an NFT marketplace.|no|
The reception wasn’t particularly overwhelming; the marketplace reportedly raked in about $2 million in sales volume, which equates to less than $50,000 in transaction fee revenue on the first day.|no|
Daily volumes have trended downward in subsequent days, but it’s far from an embarrassing launch, especially when one considers the failures endured by competing upstart marketplaces like Coinbase NFT.|no|
GameStop is hoping to find a revenue-generating vertical that decreases its reliance on brick-and-mortar sales.|no|
The timing could be better for the company as NFT dollar volumes have plummeted as crypto prices have taken a hit, but this is clearly still a vision that has registered with the company’s very unique breed of investor profile.|no|
GameStop is down more than 40% from its November highs, but things have gotten much less bleak in the past couple months as the company stock has rallied some 50%.|no|

I caught up with the founders, Sonia Nigam and Amar Shah, this week to chat about the $5 million seed round they just closed to double down on the crypto space (you can read more about that here ).|no|
They’ve historically focused on online fiat donations, but see strong potential for crypto donations because they believe the blockchain can provide the transparency donors desire but isn’t always guaranteed to them.|no|
We already know things are getting ugly during this crypto winter, so it’s especially interesting to see a startup that’s using this time to invest more deeply into its web3 capabilities rather than pumping the brakes or running for the hills.|no|

He co-led Airbnb through its down moments, too, like battles with policymakers over the legality of Airbnb listings and a steep decline in business at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.|no|
Gebbia was a major contributor to Airbnb’s early design, for example brainstorming the idea of offering free professional photography services to Airbnb hosts from a community of freelancers.|no|
NASA has just revealed the James Webb Space Telescope’s first set of images, from an awe-inspiring deep field of galaxies to a minute characterization of a distant exoplanet’s atmospher|no|

This includes images they generated during the research preview.|no|
Users have told us that they are planning to use DALL·E images for commercial projects, like illustrations for children’s books, art for newsletters, concept art and characters for games, moodboards for design consulting, and storyboards for movies.|no|
To train our image classifiers, we reused an approach that we had previously employed to filter training data for GLIDE .|no|
To reduce our classifier’s false negative rate, we employed a second active learning technique: nearest neighbor search.|no|
In particular, we ran many-fold cross-validation to find positive samples in our current labeled dataset which the model tended to misclassify as negative (to do this, we literally trained hundreds of versions of the classifier with different train-validation splits).|no|
We then scanned our large collection of unlabeled images for nearest neighbors of these samples in a perceptual feature space, and assigned human labels to the discovered images.|no|
Thanks to our compute infrastructure, it was trivial to scale up both classifier training and nearest neighbor search to many GPUs, allowing the active learning step to take place over a number of minutes rather than hours or days.|no|
Elon Musk left the board of OpenAI Nonprofit in February 2018 and is not formally involved with OpenAI LP.|no|

Stable performance of the solar reactor over a large number of redox cycles is essential for any potential commercial application.|no|
The solar reactor produced syngas with selectivity, purity, and quality suitable for FT synthesis.|no|
Although the η solar-to-syngas is still in the single digits, it has the potential to reach competitive values of over 20% by recovering rejected heat during the temperature-swing redox cycle and by improving the volumetric absorption of the porous structures.|no|
The ceria RPC remains the most critical component of the solar reactor and further progress with the manufacturing of mechanically robust porous structures remains essential.|no|
According to Bloomberg , if the nine reactors Kishida wants to come online actually do so, they could generate as much as 10 percent of the nation's energy needs.|no|
That doesn't mean people are super thrilled just yet.|no|

There's no arguing the point when mining rigs have bought up entire gas-powered power plants .|no|
It's worth noting that this is, overall, a convenient moment to pause a cryptomining operation.|no|
The cryptocurrency market has entered an epic tailspin over the past month, making mining a much less compelling use of power .|no|
It's also worth pointing out that it's fairly ridiculous that we live in a world where cryptocurrency controls 1 percent of a state's power usage.|no|
But at the same time, it could be an opportunity for the industry to rehab its tattered reputation — if it were to keep solving real problems that affect, you know, actual people.|no|
These fuels are made from recycled waste such as used cooking oil, industrial waste and agricultural and forestry residues.|no|
But industry-wide, the production of alternative fuels remains miniscule.|no|
The problem is that it takes time, investment and technology – as well as a strong policy push – to swap out a fuel as ubiquitous as kerosene.|no|
A recent paper from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found that at most 5.5% of aviation fuel in the EU could come from sustainable sources by 2030, largely from advanced waste biofuels.|no|
Alongside advanced waste biofuel, the other main short-term sustainable alternative to fossil jet fuel is synthetic fuel made using electrochemical reactions between water and captured carbon.|no|
The first flight using sustainable e-kerosene only took place this year – and even this only used 5% of it in its fuel mix.|no|
Stronger policies could push a larger dent in emissions in the next decade.|no|
So far, the major global policy to address aviation emissions has been an offsetting scheme developed by the UN aviation agency ICAO.|no|
However, the scheme has long been slammed as inadequate by campaigners, who criticise its failure to incentivise airlines to cut their own emissions by instead allowing them to buy cheap offsets, and only for only applying to emissions above 2019 and 2020 levels.|no|

ith all the hubbub about SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk being approved to buy Twitter, there remains a giant elephant in the room — and it means the deal may not go through at all.|no|
At first glance, everything looks kosher.|no|
There's also the small matter of China to contend with.|no|
As the column also explains, China is home to half of Tesla's production and a quarter of the company's revenue — and it's a serious Twitter foe, given the company's fights with Beijing over Hong Kong protests .|no|
Should China decide to interfere, it could cause a quagmire for Musk that would be nearly impossible to untangle without him walking away from buying Twitter.|no|
It's also unlikely that Musk's purported free speech absolutism, which many critics say will result in fewer penalties on hate speech and disinformation on Twitter, would even hold water when if he takes the helm of the social media company.|no|

Massive chunks of the rocket screamed over and over several major US cities before splashing down in the Atlantic Monday afternoon, as confirmed by the US Air Force .|no|
Now, it sounds as though parts falling off it may have left a trail of debris.|no|
According to The Verge , bits of the rocket appear to have touched ground on the Ivory Coast.|no|
Local media reported that mysterious metallic objects were raining from the sky.|no|
Both of these are conservative estimates, as the number of rocket launches is increasing quickly.|no|
Assuming again that each reentry spreads lethal debris over a 10m 2 area, we conclude that current practices have on order a 10% chance of one or more casualties over a decade.|no|
In the first method (perigee cut), there is no explicit reentry timescale.|no|
As such, only the year 2020 world population is used to calculate the corresponding casualty expectation.|no|
This method most clearly identifies the consequences of the long-lived on-orbit rocket body population.|no|
However, in doing so, the providers are denying themselves the opportunity for a controlled reentry.|no|
Such an approach to mission design will also have to be changed to achieve a safe, controlled reentry regime.|no|
Most of these measures cost money.|no|
In the case of the Delta IV rocket, the US government reportedly granted waivers because of the high costs of upgrades 5 , even though, as the entity procuring these launches, it was well positioned to absorb the increased cost of safer missions.|no|

This is where Moore’s Law comes into play, as a way to predict development of computer chips. Computer chips are what economists call a “general purpose technology”.|no|futechblog.com 
Technology that has such fundamental use cases that it can support a wide range of industries.|no|futechblog.com 
Moore’s Law is an expectation, not a natural law. But since Intel co-founder Gordon Moore has first talked about it in 1965, it has proved to be very accurate.|no|futechblog.com 
Let us try to derive a clear definition for Moore’s Law and get an idea of the technology behind it.|no|futechblog.com 
The era of big data. A very popular buzz word. Standing for the way how everything is generating and running on tons of data nowadays.|no|futechblog.com

It is not easy to formulate a clear definition for what biotechnology is.|no|futechblog.com 
More specifically, a collection of techniques that are about analyzing and altering the basic building blocks of life.|no|futechblog.com 
Molecular biology, as a subarea of biology, concerns structure and function of macromolecules. Central to molecular biology is research about DNA and RNA.|no|futechblog.com 
So, one way to put it, biotechnology is the notion that molecular biology is not only about understanding nature but increasingly about altering it.|no|futechblog.com 
Most agricultural goods we use today are a product of some form of biotechnology.|no|futechblog.com 
Such a segment that determines one specific characteristic of the organism is called a gene.|no|futechblog.com

How does it come that Moore’s Law has been so accurate for 50 years?|no|futechblog.com 
The constant improvement of cost to performance ratios fuels an ever-growing demand, thus an ever-growing semiconductor market.|no|futechblog.com 
As a consequence, more investment comes into the market to further improve the products.|no|futechblog.com 
The main driver has been the idea to reduce the size of circuits by scaling down transistors.|no|futechblog.com 
The smaller the transistor, the smaller the circuit, the higher the number of transistors per IC.|no|futechblog.com

Over the past two years, the World Economic Forum – working in close collaboration with a diverse group of experts – has been working on advancing the field of ethics in technology.|no|weforum.org 
This group agreed on the important goal of providing tools and techniques that leaders can use to operationalize ethics during the lifecycle of technology.|no|weforum.org

Unsustainable consumption patterns, environmental degradation, and persistent inequity are only a few of the issues that afflict modern cities.|no|weforum.org 
Anyone who has ever visited Shanghai, New York, or any other modern megacity lined with gravity-defying skyscrapers can attest to their unique capacity for scale.|no|weforum.org 
However, something much more astonishing is happening behind the scenes.|no|weforum.org 
According to recent research spearheaded by Geoffrey West and Luis Bettencourt, cities take human and physical capital and scale them superlinearly.|no|weforum.org 
In apparent defiance of traditional arithmetic, cities produce more units of output for each unit of input they use when it comes to game-changing statistics such as GDP, wages, patents, and R&D expenditures.|no|weforum.org 
Even better, cities waste fewer resources per capita on infrastructure and services.|no|weforum.org 
This makes them ideally suited for providing realistic answers to the biggest global challenges.|no|weforum.org 
Recent studies have shown that cities excel in fostering community attachment, which is found in open spaces ripe with social offerings, accessible educational systems, and opportunities for civic involvement.|no|weforum.org 
Luckily for us city dwellers, community attachment itself is a positive feedback mechanism that is correlated with overall happiness, GDP growth, and many other desired features of modern life.|no|weforum.org 
In fact, today there are already more functional cities than nation states.|no|weforum.org 
However, even with all their economic prowess and penchant for openness, cities still lack the final ingredients for sustainable dominance: political clout and sovereignty.|no|weforum.org 
From the United States’ National League of Cities to the international Global Parliament of Cities, mayors across the world are forging partnerships that derive their power from shared interests rather than geographical proximity or political collegiality.|no|weforum.org

In this new environment, business model change often translates to skill set disruption almost simultaneously and with only a minimal time lag (Figure 8A).|no|weforum.org 
Our respondents report that a tangible impact of many of these disruptions on the adequacy of employees’ existing skill sets can already be felt in a wide range of jobs and industries today (Figure 8B).|no|weforum.org 
During previous industrial revolutions, it has often taken decades to build the training systems and labour market institutions needed to develop major new skill sets on a large scale.|no|weforum.org 
Given the upcoming pace and scale of disruption brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, however, this may simply not be an option.|no|weforum.org 
For example, current technological trends are bringing about an unprecedented rate of change in the core curriculum content of many academic fields, with nearly 50% of subject knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year technical degree outdated by the time students graduate, according to one popular estimate.|no|weforum.org 
A focus on the state of the talent pipeline for traditional formal qualifications and ‘hard skills' therefore risks dramatically understating the scale of impending skill set disruption if a large part of the existing subject knowledge of the current workforce will be outdated in just a few years.|no|weforum.org 
Beyond hard skills and formal qualifications, employers are often equally concerned about the work-related practical skills or competences that current employees (or prospective new hires) are able to use in order to perform various job tasks successfully.|no|weforum.org 
There are various reasons for such dramatic shifts in expected skills requirements.|no|weforum.org 
While most jobs require use of a wide range of skills, somewhat different skill set combinations are sought after in different industry sectors.|no|weforum.org 
In light of technological trends such as the ones outlined in this Report, in recent years many countries have undertaken significant efforts to increase the amount of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates produced by their national education systems (Table 8A).|no|weforum.org 
Yet when it comes to the traditional tools policymakers and employers have at their disposal to navigate this change there often is a time lag of months, if not years, until updated information becomes available.|no|weforum.org 
For example, hundreds of millions of workers across the globe have added their professional information—including their education, skills, and past and present jobs—to online talent platforms such as LinkedIn, affording these providers with unique insights into changing skills supply.|no|weforum.org 
Around 36% of respondents also voiced a concern about the availability of qualified talent, in particular employers in the Energy, Information and Communication Technology and Mobility industries.|no|weforum.org 
The Information and Communication Technology industry sees this issue as their main barrier to a more gender balanced workforce.|no|weforum.org 
Basic and Infrastructure has a similarly low number of female junior staff, but there is less emphasis by respondents on incoming talent qualification, with unconscious bias by managers instead cited as the top concern.|no|weforum.org 
Lack of work-life balance is perceived as a particular barrier in the Consumer and Financial Services & Investors industries.|no|weforum.org 
Many employers thus believe lack of work-life balance is a key deterrent to women’s participation at work. This factor thus appears to influence all industries.|no|weforum.org 
While in nearly all industries and geographies there has been a marked shift away from deliberate exclusion of women from the workplace, there continue to be cultural beliefs that lead to unconscious biases.|no|weforum.org 
This includes perceptions that successful, competent women are less nice; that strong performance by women is due to hard work rather than skills; and assumptions that women are less committed to their careers.|no|weforum.org 
In addition, especially in well-established, older organizations, workplace structures that were designed for a past era still, often unwittingly, favour men.|no|weforum.org 
Additionally, women’s historically low participation in the labour market means they have relatively fewer role models to look towards across all industries.|no|weforum.org 
Research from the US, UK and Germany suggests that women have a poor perception of senior roles and lack a clear line of sight as to how senior leadership positions might help them achieve their objectives, lacking role models who can reveal the trade-offs and benefits they bring.|no|weforum.org 
Women’s confidence and aspirations are seen as another barrier. Women are less likely to want a top job—citing the stress or pressure of the role as a deterrent.|no|weforum.org 
In order to map labour market changes, LinkedIn’s analytics describe each job function as an agglomeration of skills, enabling the platform to nowcast changes in the skills landscape as members update their professional information.|no|weforum.org 
This enables the platform to identify clusters of skills that are particularly associated with the profiles of members with common job functions and titles and to map how these change over time.|no|weforum.org 
It also allows for identifying nuances and differences between the skill sets of common job functions in different industries or geographies.|no|weforum.org 
For example, the heatmap below shows how the most common skills reported by mechanical engineers vary across different industries.|no|weforum.org 
The dark blue color in area 1 in the chart below shows that mechanical engineers working in various sectors of the Mobility industry have similar skills.|no|weforum.org 
It also shows that their skills differ from the skills of mechanical engineers who work in the Healthcare industry (area 2) or the Energy and Basic and Infrastructure sectors (areas 3 and 4).|no|weforum.org 
This supply-side analysis can be complemented with analysis of skills demand—whether based on job listings, within-job hiring rates, governmental forecasts, or employer surveys such as the one presented in this Report—to identify emerging skills gaps and inform training and skills programmes to prepare the workforce for future requirements.|no|weforum.org 
At the national level, countries experience varying inflows and outflows of talent over time.|no|weforum.org 
Outflows and inflows of talent often do not have the same skills compositions, resulting in a correlation between talent mobility and changing skills gaps across countries and over time.|no|weforum.org 
At same time, however, job families expecting the highest employment growth, such as Architecture and Engineering and Computer and Mathematical, currently have some of the lowest female participation and find it much harder than average to recruit women.|no|weforum.org 
Our respondents’ views concerning the barriers to women’s workforce participation vary by industry and often reflect different industry cultures in addition to overarching economic and societal factors.|no|weforum.org 
Finally, where each industry stands specifically is often affected by how recently an industry has improved its gender balance.|no|weforum.org 
Given that career choices are disproportionately affected by prior experience and bias, traditionally male dominated professions often find it difficult to attract women.|no|weforum.org 
TODAY, HOMES ARE increasingly “smart,” with wired fridges, doorbells, and other WiFi-enabled devices booming.|no|WIRED.com 
And yet, of all home security concerns, one of the most critical tech upgrades is happening in a space often overlooked: the very air we breathe.|no|WIRED.com 
Smart Detection is an array of WiFi-enabled alarms that detect threats of smoke, carbon monoxide (CO), water leaks, frozen pipes, and indoor air quality issues, and it provides alerts—all monitored by homeowners in a single app.|no|WIRED.com 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), roughly 50,000 people per year go to the emergency room due to accidental carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|no|WIRED.com 
Using a built-in air quality sensor, the WiFi-enabled device measures a home’s temperature, humidity, and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), which are harmful airborne irritants that come from everyday items like ​​paints and lacquers, cleaning supplies, pesticides, cosmetics, and building materials.|no|WIRED.com 
Electricity production and heat add up to a quarter of all global emissions and, since almost every activity you can imagine requires electricity, cleaning up power grids has huge knock-on effects.|no|WIRED.com 
The foothills of the Swiss Alps is a fitting location for a gravity energy storage startup: A short drive east from Energy Vault’s offices will take you to the Contra Dam, a concrete edifice made famous in the opening scene of GoldenEye, where James Bond bungee-jumps down the dam’s 220-meter-high face to infiltrate a top-secret Soviet chemical weapons facility.|no|WIRED.com

There is an assumption that the more scientific the approach to predictions, the more accurate forecasts will be.|no|WIRED.com 
Since the earliest civilizations, the most important distinction in this practice has been between individuals who have an intrinsic gift or ability to predict the future, and systems that provide rules for calculating futures.|no|WIRED.com 
At the same time, rather than depending on technological advances, other forecasters have turned to the strategy of crowdsourcing predictions of the future.|no|WIRED.com 
Polling public and private opinions, for example, depends on something very simple—asking people what they intend to do or what they think will happen.|no|WIRED.com 
Assembling a panel of experts to discuss a given topic, the thinking goes, is likely to be more accurate than individual prognostication.|no|WIRED.com 
Reports in both the US and the UK, for example, stressed the significance of public health systems in responding effectively to a global crisis, but they did not convince either country to bolster their systems.|no|WIRED.com

Today, not only does China produce the majority of the world’s EV batteries, it’s also forging ahead with the development and manufacturing of EVs—and selling them to the world.|no|WIRED.com 
“Foreign auto brands were seen as the most desirable, but that’s different for electric vehicles,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has researched the Chinese EV industry.|no|WIRED.com 
And local governments offer plenty of incentives: In some cities, EV owners pay less for license plates and can keep driving on days when conventional vehicles are restricted due to high air pollution.|no|WIRED.com 
In 2009, China’s government enacted a series of policies to promote research and development and encourage state oil companies to invest in EV infrastructure.|no|WIRED.com 
China’s interoperability gives it an advantage over other countries that are trying to encourage EV adoption, says Anders Hove, a Beijing-based researcher for the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.|no|WIRED.com 
Drivers can plug into any outlet and generally don’t need special cards or subscriptions, and they can pay with QR codes using common payment methods such as WeChat Pay or Alipay.|no|WIRED.com 
The government has also heavily subsidized all aspects of the industry, including battery manufacturing.

BCIs will allow humans to control computers and thus move objects only by thinking about it!|yes|futechblog.com 
First off, there are a lot of beneficial use cases that will not immediately, drastically change our world.|yes|futechblog.com 
Another example, BCIs will soon be used in computer games.|yes|futechblog.com 
Computer mice for games become more and more complex, but the developers cannot put an infinite amount of buttons on them. So, controlling additional things in the game via thoughts can be the future here.|yes|futechblog.com

Having your brain connected to the internet would mean that you can text other people via thought. Or even talk to other people through that connection, without actually opening your mouth.|yes|futechblog.com 
If we think it through to the utmost extreme, you could not only share thoughts with anyone but also emotions or experiences and memories.|yes|futechblog.com 
Just implant for example a radio wave detector somewhere into the body and connect it with the BCI in the brain. The BCI will then feed the respective electrochemical signals to the natural part of the brain. The product would then be a human that can experience radio waves.|yes|futechblog.com

Retailers will operate at a higher order of magnitude on productivity, which will in turn result in positive and enticing returns in the online grocery business (unheard of at the moment).|yes|weforum.org 
In the next few years we can expect to see this progress accelerate, with AI technology built to connect people at a human level and drive them closer to each other, even when physically they’re apart.|yes|weforum.org 
The line between physical space and virtual will forever be blurred.|yes|weforum.org 
We’ll start to see capabilities for global events - from SXSW to the Glastonbury Festival - to provide fully digitalized alternatives, beyond simple live streaming into full experiences.|yes|weforum.org 
However, it’s not as simple as just providing these services - data privacy will have to be prioritised in order to create confidence among consumers.|yes|weforum.org 
By 2025, the lines separating culture, information technology and health will be blurred.|yes|weforum.org 
Engineering biology, machine learning and the sharing economy will establish a framework for decentralising the healthcare continuum, moving it from institutions to the individual.|yes|weforum.org 
Propelling this forward are advances in artificial intelligence and new supply chain delivery mechanisms, which require the real-time biological data that engineering biology will deliver as simple, low-cost diagnostic tests to individuals in every corner of the globe. As a result, morbidity, mortality and costs will decrease in acute conditions, such as infectious diseases, because only the most severe cases will need additional care.|yes|weforum.org 
Fewer infected people will leave their homes, dramatically altering disease epidemiology while decreasing the burden on healthcare systems.|yes|weforum.org 
Inextricable links between health, socio-economic status and quality of life will begin to loosen, and tensions that exist by equating health with access to healthcare institutions will dissipate.|yes|weforum.org 
From daily care to pandemics, these converging technologies will alter economic and social factors to relieve many pressures on the global human condition.|yes|weforum.org

Every surface on Earth carries hidden information that will prove essential for avoiding pandemic-related crises, both now and in the future.|yes|weforum.org 
Technology that accelerates our ability to rapidly sample, digitalize and interpret microbiome data will transform our understanding of how pathogens spread. Exposing this invisible microbiome data layer will identify genetic signatures that can predict when and where people and groups are shedding pathogens, which surfaces and environments present the highest transmission risk, and how these risks are impacted by our actions and change over time.|yes|weforum.org 
We are just scratching the surface of what microbiome data insights offer and will see this accelerate over the next five years. These insights will not only help us avoid and respond to pandemics, but will influence how we design, operate and clean environments like buildings, cars, subways and planes, in addition to how we support economic activity without sacrificing public health.|yes|weforum.org 
Over the next five years, carbon-heavy industries will use machine learning and AI technology to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint.|yes|weforum.org 
Indeed, as a result of increasing digital transformation, carbon-heavy sectors will be able to utilize advanced technologies, like AI and machine learning, using real-time, high-fidelity data from billions of connected devices to efficiently and proactively reduce harmful emissions and decrease carbon footprints.|yes|weforum.org 
Five years from now, privacy and data-centric security will have reached commodity status – and the ability for consumers to protect and control sensitive data assets will be viewed as the rule rather than the exception.|yes|weforum.org 
As awareness and understanding continue to build, so will the prevalence of privacy preserving and enhancing capabilities, namely privacy-enhancing technologies (PET). By 2025, PET as a technology category will become mainstream.|yes|weforum.org 
While the world will still lack a global privacy standard, organizations will embrace a data-centric approach to security that provides the flexibility necessary to adapt to regional regulations and consumer expectations.|yes|weforum.org 
These efforts will be led by cross-functional teams representing the data, privacy and security interests within an organization.|yes|weforum.org 
The next five years will see profound improvements in addressing these challenges as entrepreneurs, the investment community and the world’s largest enterprise R&D organizations focus on developing and deploying solutions that will deliver tangible results.|yes|weforum.org 
With human rights groups like Amnesty International putting a spotlight on this issue, along with the rise of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and increased calls for stakeholder capitalism, we predict that there will be more progress in responsible investing in tech – especially in the venture capital space – in the coming years.|yes|weforum.org 
The Chinese government released a document in August 2021 stating that authorities will actively promote legislation in areas such as national security, technology innovation and anti-monopoly.|yes|weforum.org 
We predict that future regulations will be more targeted towards specific technologies, industries, use cases, risk profiles and affected communities.|yes|weforum.org 
As technology ethics issues continue to permeate public awareness, we predict that most universities will offer more courses on technology ethics and make them compulsory for students to graduate with degrees in technical fields.|yes|weforum.org 
With new technologies permeating more and more of our daily lives, the field of responsible technology is expanding.|yes|weforum.org 
As the world becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, it is a holistic and multi-pronged approach to governance that will enable communities to experience the benefits and avoid the harms of these new technologies.|yes|weforum.org 
Instead of deurbanization, the next decades will see cities forging powerful international partnerships and taking the lead in solving global problems.|yes|weforum.org 
In 2020, we will witness the coming of age of the first cohorts of the Generation C (“C” for connected) that have lived their entire lives surrounded by the digital world.|yes|weforum.org 
By then, the four horsemen of the Fourth Industrial Revolution – automation, augmented reality, cloud computing, and ambient intelligence – will have ushered in Industry 4.0 in all its digital splendor.|yes|weforum.org 
Together with the steady retreat of the baby boomers, the advent of the digital age will be reason enough for Generation C and the Millennials to reinvent both how and where they work.|yes|weforum.org 
With each incremental improvement in connectivity brought by digitization, the labor force – just like work itself – will become increasingly mobile.|yes|weforum.org 
Digitization will also ensure that the very meaning of mobility will change.|yes|weforum.org 
Indeed, Generation C will be the first cohort of workers to be mobile on their own terms, moving freely where others before them relocated out of necessity.|yes|weforum.org 
At the same time, digitization will continue reshaping the contours of productivity at large. Most importantly, it will continue increasing the benefits of clustering in major sectors, such as manufacturing, financial services, and hospitality.|yes|weforum.org 
Key among the entrepreneurs, who will inhabit and prosper in these clusters, will be “micro-multinationals” using digital platforms such as eBay, Alibaba, and Amazon to leap across geographical divides.|yes|weforum.org 
As a result, the gravitational pull of cities will only grow stronger.|yes|weforum.org 
The capacity of cities to create unprecedented levels of economic activity and innovation will all but ensure that they will take the lead in the century ahead.|yes|weforum.org 
From a skills perspective, they will need to learn to more quickly anticipate these new consumer values, to translate them into product offerings and to become ever more knowledgeable about the processes involved in meeting these demands and the impact this may have on their employees’ current skill sets and working practices.|yes|weforum.org 
However, along with the impact of disruptive changes on these sectors, it is anticipated that complex problem solving skills will become somewhat less important in industries that are heavily technical today—such as Basic and Infrastructure and Energy—in which technology may automate and take on a bigger part of these complex tasks going forward, and will ascend in those industries, such as Professional Services and Information and Communication Technology, that are expected to become more complex and analytical due to these trends.|yes|weforum.org 
In the Consumer sector, for example, vast amounts of data will allow for increased sophistication in inventory management, customer segmentation and product personalization, involving some use and familiarity with technology by jobs at all levels, from retail assistant through to more senior positions.|yes|weforum.org 
Overall, social skills—such as persuasion, emotional intelligence and teaching others—will be in higher demand across industries than narrow technical skills, such as programming or equipment operation and control.|yes|weforum.org 
As noted earlier, in the face of rapidly rising computing power, an ability to work with data and make data-based decisions will become an increasingly vital skill across many job families as employers scramble to build a workforce with solid skills in data analysis and presentation (e.g. through visualization) and the amount of potentially useful digital information generated and stored keeps increasing exponentially.|yes|weforum.org 
On average, by 2020, more than a third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations will be comprised of skills that are not yet considered crucial to the job today, according to our respondents.|yes|weforum.org 
ital platforms will enable unforeseen levels of accountability, access, and openness, forever changing how local governments interact with the people they govern.|yes|weforum.org 
Indeed, the time when governments see us as customers rather than citizens may be closer than we imagine.|yes|weforum.org 
Content skills (which include ICT literacy and active learning), cognitive abilities (such as creativity and mathematical reasoning) and process skills (such as active listening and critical thinking) will be a growing part of the core skills requirements for many industries.|yes|weforum.org 
For example, the increasing ubiquity of mobile internet combined with the coming-of-age of the Internet of Things promises to transform the daily routine of many frontline roles in the Sales and Related, Installation and Maintenance, and Manufacturing and Production job families across all industries, requiring a much higher level of technology literacy than in the past.|yes|weforum.org 
As an ancillary characteristic to increased automation in these fields, employees are expected to have more responsibilities related to equipment control and maintenance and problem-solving skills, as well as a broader general understanding of the work processes of their company or organization.|yes|weforum.org 
Many formerly purely technical occupations are expected to show a new demand for creative and interpersonal skills.|yes|weforum.org 
For healthcare practitioners, for example, technological innovations will allow for increasing automation of diagnosis and personalization of treatments, redefining many medical roles towards translating and communicating this data effectively to patients.|yes|weforum.org 
Similarly, Sales and Related jobs may see an increased demand for creative skills and ideas for promoting a memorable shopping experience, as brick-and-mortar retail has to reposition itself in relation to e-commerce and online competition.|yes|weforum.org 
Overall, our respondents anticipate that a wide range of occupations will require a higher degree of cognitive abilities—such as creativity, logical reasoning and problem sensitivity—as part of their core skill set.|yes|weforum.org 
At the other end of the scale, among all jobs requiring physical abilities less than one third (31%) are expected to have a growing demand for these in the future, about as many as the proportion of jobs in which physical abilities are anticipated to decline in importance (27%).|yes|weforum.org 
The skills bundle with the most stable demand across all jobs requiring these skills today or in the future are technical skills: nearly half (44%) of all jobs requiring these skills today will have a stable need for them in the coming years.|yes|weforum.org 
What we have found instead is that disruptive changes will have a significant impact on skills requirements in all job families and that they are creating a range of opportunities and challenges in all industries, not just narrowly related to ‘hard knowledge’, technical skills and technology.|yes|weforum.org 
Increased collaboration between stakeholders such as online talent platforms, human resources consulting firms, employers, policymakers, labour unions and education providers, has the potential to substantially improve the speed and precision of future workforce planning and managing organizational change.|yes|weforum.org 
As the Fourth Industrial Revolution takes hold in different industries and job families, it will affect female and male workers in distinct ways.|yes|weforum.org 
In short, as industries prepare to adapt to disruptive change the dynamics of the industry gender gap will be at the centre of many facets of the new employment landscape.|yes|weforum.org 
According to a March 2022 industry report, the global market for home security is expected to rise from $2.9 billion in 2019 to an estimated $12.8 billion in 2026, driven by a rise in Internet of Things (IoT) technology and growing anxiety about broader safety concerns.|yes|WIRED.com 
Going forward, home safety will continue to be a top priority for homeowners.|yes|WIRED.com 
Finding green energy when the winds are calm and the skies are cloudy has been a challenge. Storing it in giant concrete blocks could be the answer.|yes|WIRED.com 
Storing energy in this way could help solve the biggest problem facing the transition to renewable electricity: finding a zero-carbon way to keep the lights on when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.|yes|WIRED.com 
If our electricity gets greener, so do our homes, industries, and transport systems. This will become even more critical as more parts of our lives become electrified— particularly heating and transport, which will be difficult to decarbonize in any other way. All of this electrification is expected to double electricity production by 2050 according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.|yes|WIRED.com 
According to a recent industry report drawing on interviews with 100 executives around the world, nine out of ten businesses will be combining on-site and remote work going forward, yet companies still struggle with how to keep employees in both places connected.|yes|WIRED.com 
Going forward, companies need tools that make collaborating from anywhere a seamless experience, and one company is leading the way: Logitech.|yes|WIRED.com 
“At a football game, for instance, there isn’t one camera that stays stationary. Instead, there are multiple cameras that move around while offering data, so you’ve always got the best angle and the latest statistics. Because of that, some might say watching the big game at home is the better experience. And that’s what we’re applying to offices for the future of hybrid work: smart technology that eventually makes the remote meeting experience even better than being in the room.”|yes|WIRED.com 
IF YOU COULD predict your death, would you want to? For most of human history, the answer has been a qualified yes.|yes|WIRED.com 
Robotics companies will want to be in the same position, as no company will want to be liable for damage to children, so it is likely that manufacturers will undersell the artificial intelligence (AI) and interactive capacities of their robots. It is therefore likely that any robots (and certainly those in jurisdictions with strong consumer protection) will be marketed primarily as toys, surveillance devices, and possibly household utilities. They will be brightly colored and deliberately designed to appeal to parents and children.|yes|WIRED.com 
But robots will always have disclaimers, such as “this device is not a toy and should only be used with adult supervision” or “this device is provided for entertainment only. It should not be considered educational.”|yes|WIRED.com 
Parents will quickly notice the educational benefits of robot nannies that have advanced AI and communication skills.|yes|WIRED.com 
This will likely continue until or unless the incidence of injuries necessitates redesign, a revision of consumer safety standards, statutory notice requirements, and/or risk-based uninsurability, all of which will further refine the industry.|yes|WIRED.com 
Meanwhile, the media will also seize on stories of robots saving children in unexpected ways, as it does now when children (or adults) are saved by other young children and dogs.|yes|WIRED.com 
What robotics manufacturers will need to worry about is that robots will be banned due to incredibly rare cases of neglect or misuse, as with extremely popular children’s toys such as assisted walkers and lawn darts.|yes|WIRED.com 
Nurseries may be able to support more children, and more people could be attracted to the field or prove competent in it with the addition of AI assistance.|yes|WIRED.com 
Robots may therefore increase the probability that children develop bonding issues with their parents and friends. Some children will prefer the more reliable style of interactions they find with machines—just as some prefer simpler interactions with animals or the high-bandwidth, low-risk stimulation of books.|yes|WIRED.com 
Our concern is that children who prefer the predictable interactions with robots may be setting themselves up for a life-long preference for machines over humans.|yes|WIRED.com 
Gauging the individual capability of each child to engage in certain activities may be augmented as it is now by technology, but it will remain a parental duty.|yes|WIRED.com 
For example, it will be more difficult to protect or restrict children from perceived danger if a child can use their AI to present empirical data to the contrary.|yes|WIRED.com 
As children mature and grow in their understanding of AI and robotics, we can expect they may convert these devices into personalized legal and advocacy tools.|yes|WIRED.com 
We believe it is unlikely that robots will cause significant psychological damage.|yes|WIRED.com 
The bottom line is that the robots themselves will not love our children.|yes|WIRED.com 
And as with many far less engaging toys, we must always remember that children will love their robots.|yes|WIRED.com 
The companies that succeed in this new era will be the ones that understand how multiple data points come together to provide new insight, and that’s achieved with a database management system that offers speed and flexibility to adapt to any need.|yes|WIRED.com

In October 2018 the UN warned that humanity has 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change. That means that by 2030, we’ll need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions in half, not so much a tall order as a towering one, given that emissions are still rising year to year.|yes|WIRED.com 
The next decade will see a more than hundredfold boom in the world’s output of human genetic data.|yes|WIRED.com 
Bigger samples will also make it possible to forecast even complex traits—like height or susceptibility to heart disease—from DNA.|yes|WIRED.com 
A world so saturated with genetic data will come with its own risks. The emergence of genetic surveillance states and the end of genetic privacy loom.|yes|WIRED.com
